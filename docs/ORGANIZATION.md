# Documentation Organization

This document describes how the documentation was organized on 2025-10-21.

## Before (Root Directory)

The root directory had **17 markdown files**, making it cluttered and hard to navigate:

```
travelblog/
├── README.md
├── CORRECT_URLS.md
├── CUSTOM_DOMAIN_DEPLOYMENT.md
├── DEPLOYMENT.md
├── FILES.md
├── GITHUB_PAGES_FIX.md
├── MIGRATION_STATUS.md
├── PROJECT.md
├── QUICKSTART.md
├── READY_TO_DEPLOY.md
├── ROUTING-TEST-INSTRUCTIONS.md
├── SSG_IMPLEMENTATION.md
├── TESTING_GUIDE.md
├── URL_REFERENCE.md
├── migration_plan.md
├── migration_plan_SSG.md
└── migration_plan_lazy_loading.md
```

## After (Organized)

Root directory now has **only 1 markdown file** (README.md), with all other docs organized in `docs/`:

```
travelblog/
├── README.md                    # Main project README
└── docs/                        # All documentation
    ├── README.md                # Documentation index
    ├── deployment/              # Deployment guides
    │   ├── CUSTOM_DOMAIN_DEPLOYMENT.md
    │   ├── DEPLOYMENT.md
    │   ├── GITHUB_PAGES_FIX.md
    │   └── READY_TO_DEPLOY.md
    ├── implementation/          # Technical implementation
    │   ├── ROUTING-TEST-INSTRUCTIONS.md
    │   ├── SSG_IMPLEMENTATION.md
    │   └── TESTING_GUIDE.md
    ├── migration/               # Migration history
    │   ├── MIGRATION_STATUS.md
    │   ├── migration_plan.md
    │   ├── migration_plan_SSG.md
    │   └── migration_plan_lazy_loading.md
    └── reference/               # Quick reference
        ├── CORRECT_URLS.md
        ├── FILES.md
        ├── PROJECT.md
        ├── QUICKSTART.md
        └── URL_REFERENCE.md
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner root directory** - Easier to find code files
2. **Logical organization** - Docs grouped by purpose
3. **Better navigation** - Index files in each directory
4. **Professional structure** - Standard practice for open-source projects
5. **Easier maintenance** - Know where to add new docs

## Directory Purposes

### `docs/deployment/`
Everything related to deploying the site:
- GitHub Pages setup
- Custom domain configuration
- Deployment troubleshooting
- Platform-specific guides (Cloudflare, Netlify)

### `docs/implementation/`
Technical implementation details:
- How SSG works
- Testing procedures
- Architecture decisions
- Development guidelines

### `docs/migration/`
Historical migration documents:
- Migration plans
- Architecture evolution
- Performance improvements
- Status updates

### `docs/reference/`
Quick reference materials:
- URL guides
- Project structure
- Quick start guides
- File organization

## Finding Documentation

### Main Entry Points

1. **[README.md](../README.md)** (root) - Project overview, quick start
2. **[docs/README.md](README.md)** - Complete documentation index

### Quick Links

**Need to deploy?**
→ [docs/deployment/READY_TO_DEPLOY.md](deployment/READY_TO_DEPLOY.md)

**Setting up custom domain?**
→ [docs/deployment/CUSTOM_DOMAIN_DEPLOYMENT.md](deployment/CUSTOM_DOMAIN_DEPLOYMENT.md)

**What are the correct URLs?**
→ [docs/reference/URL_REFERENCE.md](reference/URL_REFERENCE.md)

**How does SSG work?**
→ [docs/implementation/SSG_IMPLEMENTATION.md](implementation/SSG_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

**Need to test changes?**
→ [docs/implementation/TESTING_GUIDE.md](implementation/TESTING_GUIDE.md)

## File Movements

| Old Location (Root) | New Location |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_DEPLOYMENT.md` | `docs/deployment/CUSTOM_DOMAIN_DEPLOYMENT.md` |
| `DEPLOYMENT.md` | `docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT.md` |
| `GITHUB_PAGES_FIX.md` | `docs/deployment/GITHUB_PAGES_FIX.md` |
| `READY_TO_DEPLOY.md` | `docs/deployment/READY_TO_DEPLOY.md` |
| `SSG_IMPLEMENTATION.md` | `docs/implementation/SSG_IMPLEMENTATION.md` |
| `TESTING_GUIDE.md` | `docs/implementation/TESTING_GUIDE.md` |
| `ROUTING-TEST-INSTRUCTIONS.md` | `docs/implementation/ROUTING-TEST-INSTRUCTIONS.md` |
| `migration_plan.md` | `docs/migration/migration_plan.md` |
| `migration_plan_SSG.md` | `docs/migration/migration_plan_SSG.md` |
| `migration_plan_lazy_loading.md` | `docs/migration/migration_plan_lazy_loading.md` |
| `MIGRATION_STATUS.md` | `docs/migration/MIGRATION_STATUS.md` |
| `CORRECT_URLS.md` | `docs/reference/CORRECT_URLS.md` |
| `URL_REFERENCE.md` | `docs/reference/URL_REFERENCE.md` |
| `FILES.md` | `docs/reference/FILES.md` |
| `PROJECT.md` | `docs/reference/PROJECT.md` |
| `QUICKSTART.md` | `docs/reference/QUICKSTART.md` |
| `README.md` | *(stayed in root)* |

## Adding New Documentation

When adding new documentation, place it in the appropriate directory:

**Deployment-related?**
→ `docs/deployment/`

**Implementation/technical?**
→ `docs/implementation/`

**Reference/guide?**
→ `docs/reference/`

**Migration/history?**
→ `docs/migration/`

Then update:
1. `docs/README.md` - Add link in appropriate section
2. Root `README.md` - Add to main docs section if important

## Summary

✅ Root directory cleaned up (17 files → 1 file)
✅ Documentation logically organized
✅ Easy to find what you need
✅ Professional project structure
✅ Better for contributors and future maintenance

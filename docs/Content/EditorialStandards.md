I want for a given blog entry or entries (either malaga.md, or 'spain') not “does this look good?”  I want a system that tries to decide whether a post is genuinely strong — in a durable, editorial sense.

This is a structured evaluation framework tailored specifically to your site — mature, reflective, experience-driven travel writing.

------

# Two Travel Nuts — Editorial Quality Framework

Think of this as your internal scoring rubric.  First I want to measure pure sentence quality and somehow 'tag' poor sentences, using these criteria.  This is a clean, practical **Sentence-Level Quality Checklist** you can use to tag weak sentences.

------

# Two Travel Nuts — Sentence-Level Audit Framework

Use this when editing drafts.

Tag sentences that violate one or more of these.

------

# 1️⃣ Length & Clarity

### 🚩 Red Flag: Overlong Sentence

**Rule of thumb:**

- 20–25 words = fine
- 25–30 words = examine
- 30+ words = probably needs splitting

Especially if:

- It contains 2+ commas
- It contains “which,” “that,” “while,” “although,” etc.
- It shifts ideas midstream

### Bad Pattern

> Malaga is interesting in that it's a combination of a cruise ship port (blech), a seaside destination, largely for Brits, but also has interesting historic sites.

Too many pivots in one breath.

### Fix Pattern

Break into 2 sentences.
Let each idea stand.

------

# 2️⃣ Passive Voice (When It Weakens Authority)

Passive isn’t always bad.

But it’s weak when it removes agency.

### 🚩 Red Flag Words

- was
- were
- is
- are
- had been
- it was

Especially when followed by a past participle.

### Weak

> The castle was visited by many tourists.

### Strong

> Tourists crowd the castle.

In travel writing, passive voice often sneaks in during:

- Logistics
- Hotel descriptions
- Reflections

You don’t need zero passive voice.
But if more than ~10–15% of sentences are passive, it dulls energy.

------

# 3️⃣ Weak Openings

Many weak sentences begin with:

- There is…
- There are…
- It is…
- It was…
- We were able to…
- We really enjoyed…

These create low-energy starts.

### Weak

> There are a number of restaurants along the coast.

### Stronger

> Restaurants line the coast.

------

# 4️⃣ Hedging & Soft Language

Mature tone ≠ timid tone.

Watch for:

- kind of
- sort of
- somewhat
- fairly
- quite (overused)
- maybe
- perhaps
- pretty

Hedging reduces authority.

### Weak

> It was fairly interesting.

### Strong

> It was interesting.

You can still be nuanced.
But cut filler hedging.

------

# 5️⃣ Redundant Modifiers

Travel writing often piles adjectives.

### 🚩 Red Flag

Adjective clusters.

> Beautiful, charming, picturesque white village.

Pick one.

Let nouns do the work.

------

# 6️⃣ Repetition Across Paragraphs

Look for repeated sentence structures.

Example pattern:

- “We enjoyed…”
- “We enjoyed…”
- “We enjoyed…”

Or:

- “It was…”
- “It was…”

Even if each sentence is fine, repetition dulls rhythm.

------

# 7️⃣ Abstract Words Without Anchoring

Words like:

- interesting
- nice
- great
- enjoyable
- beautiful

These are vague.

If you use them, ask:
**Why? Compared to what?**

Instead of:

> The views were beautiful.

Try:

> The cliffs drop sharply into the Mediterranean, and the late light turns them copper.

Concrete beats abstract.

------

# 8️⃣ Long Paragraph Density

Even if sentences are fine individually, 5–7 long sentences in a row create drag.

Your rule:

- 2–4 sentences per paragraph
- Vary lengths
- One short sentence occasionally for impact

------

# 9️⃣ Rhythm Check

Read aloud.

If you run out of breath → sentence too long.

If every sentence is the same length → monotony.

You want variation:

- Medium
- Medium
- Short.
- Longer reflective one.
- Medium

------

# 10️⃣ “Does This Say Anything New?”

Sometimes sentences aren’t wrong.
They’re unnecessary.

Ask:
If I delete this, does meaning change?

If not — cut.

Tight writing feels confident.

------

# A Practical Editing Workflow

When revising a post:

1. Highlight all sentences over 25 words.
2. Highlight all sentences starting with:
   - There
   - It
   - We were
3. Circle all vague adjectives.
4. Look for 3+ sentences in a row of similar length.
5. Cut 10% of total words.

That alone improves 90% of drafts.

------

# Maybe Try Something More Systematic

Could we build a simple “Red Tag” system:

Tag sentences with:

- [LONG]
- [PASSIVE]
- [HEDGE]
- [VAGUE]
- [REDUNDANT]
- [FLAT]

Then revise only tagged sentences.

------

> **Malaga is interesting in that it’s a combination of a cruise ship port (blech), a seaside destination, largely for Brits, but also has interesting historic sites.**
>  🚩 [LONG] (33 words)
>  🚩 [WEAK OPENING – “is interesting in that”]
>  🚩 [VAGUE – “interesting” x2]
>  🚩 [CLUTTERED STRUCTURE – too many pivots in one sentence]

------

> **We enjoyed it but I wouldn’t call it a highlight compared to the other areas we saw.**
>  ⚠️ [FLAT – “We enjoyed it” is low-energy phrasing]
>  ⚠️ [VAGUE – “highlight” is abstract but salvageable]
>  ✅ Structurally fine length

------

> **But to be fair, the day we arrived was the most old-testament-style rain we experienced in a 3-week trip, which may have colored our experience.**
>  🚩 [LONG – 29 words]
>  🚩 [PASSIVE – “was” + “may have colored” softens impact]
>  ⚠️ [HEDGE – “may have” reduces authority]
>  ✅ “old-testament-style rain” is vivid and strong

------

Now let me show you what tightening looks like while preserving your tone.

------

## Revision Example 

+ ***I don't want Claude to rewrite my blog, but I'm open to a system where it suggests improvements given my raw material.***

Malaga is a cruise ship port (blech) and a seaside destination largely catering to Brits, but it also has genuine historic sites.

We enjoyed it, though it wasn’t a highlight compared to the other areas we visited.

In fairness, we arrived during the most Old Testament rainstorm of our three-week trip. That likely colored our impression.

------

Notice what changed:

- Removed “is interesting in that”
- Split the first sentence
- Replaced vague “interesting”
- Reduced hedging
- Converted passive to more active phrasing
- Kept your voice

------

# Important: Don’t Over-Optimize

You are not writing Hemingway.

You are writing reflective travel.

Some longer sentences are good — especially reflective ones.

The goal is not short sentences.

The goal is controlled sentences.



# Two Travel Nuts — Page-Level Audit Framework

I also want each post to be evaluated across a variety of "page-level" dimensions.  I suggest some here but am open to your suggestions.

------

# 1️⃣ Narrative Clarity (Structure & Flow)

**Question:** Does the post feel intentionally shaped, or like chronological documentation?

### Strong Post

- Clear beginning (context)
- Middle (experiences + reflection)
- End (synthesis or takeaway)
- No section feels like filler
- No abrupt transitions

### Weak Post

- “Then we did this… then this…”
- Long unbroken blocks
- Logistics dropped without narrative framing
- Ends without insight

**Target Standard:**
Reader could summarize your perspective in one sentence.

------

# 2️⃣ Voice & Perspective (Why You?)

This is your differentiator.

**Question:** Does this feel like Kevin & Tiffany — or like a generic travel guide?

### Strong Post

- Contains judgment (“beautiful but…”)
- Contains comparison
- Contains restraint
- Avoids hype language
- Avoids Instagram tone

### Weak Post

- Pure description
- Overly enthusiastic
- No evaluation
- No tension

**Target Standard:**
At least 2–3 moments of honest perspective per post.

------

# 3️⃣ Reflective Depth (Emotional Layer)

This is where your blog becomes publication-level.

**Question:** Does the post pause to reflect?

### Strong Post

- At least one reflective moment
- A pull-quote-worthy sentence
- A thought that lingers

Example:

> “Quite beautiful, but suffers if you’ve just been to the Alhambra.”

That’s editorial.

### Weak Post

- Only what happened
- No why it mattered
- No contrast

**Target Standard:**
Minimum one reflective passage per 800–1000 words.

------

# 4️⃣ Visual Rhythm (Design Integration)

Now we evaluate layout quality.

**Question:** Does the page breathe?

### Strong Post

- No more than 3–4 paragraphs without interruption
- Images vary in orientation
- Captions feel archival, not decorative
- No two heavy blocks stacked

### Weak Post

- Image clusters
- Paragraph walls
- Inconsistent spacing
- Mid-page fatigue

**Target Standard:**
Scroll should feel paced, not dense.

------

# 5️⃣ Practical Value (Reader Utility)

You’re not a guidebook — but you still provide value.

**Question:** Does a reader learn something actionable?

### Strong Post

- At least one practical insight
- Honest hotel assessment
- Specific recommendation or caution
- Clear “worth it / not worth it” moments

### Weak Post

- Pure memoir
- No practical signal
- No cost/effort/value evaluation

**Target Standard:**
Reader walks away knowing what to prioritize or skip.

------

# 6️⃣ Energy Curve (Momentum Across Page)

This is the advanced metric.

**Question:** Does the post maintain engagement throughout?

Visualize the energy like a graph:

Intro
⬆
Peak moment
⬇
Reflection
⬆
Visual reset
⬇
Conclusion

### Strong Post

- Middle does not sag
- Emotional reset exists
- Conclusion feels intentional

### Weak Post

- Mid-section drag
- Flat energy
- Abrupt ending

**Target Standard:**
No section where the reader might think “okay, next.”

------

# Scoring Model (If You Want Something Concrete)

Rate each dimension 1–5.

| Category        | 1–2           | 3             | 4–5                   |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Narrative       | Chronological | Clear         | Shaped + intentional  |
| Voice           | Generic       | Personal      | Distinct + honest     |
| Reflection      | None          | Some          | Memorable             |
| Visual Rhythm   | Dense         | Clean         | Paced                 |
| Practical Value | Minimal       | Useful        | Insightful            |
| Energy Curve    | Flat          | Mostly steady | Intentionally dynamic |

A post scoring:

- 18–21 = Solid
- 22–25 = Strong
- 26–30 = A-tier

------

# What Makes an A-Tier Two Travel Nuts Post?

An A-tier post:

- Has at least one line someone might quote
- Contains honest restraint
- Has visual breathing room
- Doesn’t overexplain
- Ends with perspective, not logistics

It feels calm and assured.

------

# The Meta-Criterion

Above all else:

**Does this post align with “Exploring well, not just often”?**

If a post could belong on a high-volume travel influencer site, it’s not aligned.

If it feels measured, reflective, and selective — it is.

# Two Travel Nuts — Editorial Standards

This document defines enforceable publishing standards.

---

## Rating Scale

- 9.5+ → Exceptional. Rare.
- 9.0–9.4 → Excellent.
- 8.5–8.9 → Publisher-ready.
- 7.5–8.4 → Good but flawed.
- 6.5–7.4 → Not publishable without revision.
- Below 6.5 → Fundamentally incomplete.

Scores should cluster in the 7–8 range.  
9+ must be rare.

If any scoring dimension is below 8.0, the article is not launch-ready.

## Structural Thresholds

- No paragraph over ~150 words.
- Break paragraphs at 5–6 visual lines.
- Subheading every 400–600 words.
- No uninterrupted history block over ~250 words.
- Avoid 4 or more consecutive long sentences (>25 words).
Isolated long sentences are acceptable in reflective prose.
- Avoid repeated adjectives within 3 paragraphs.
- Mature reflective tone may include longer sentences; penalize density only when it harms readability.
- Violations of structural thresholds must reduce the sentence_structure score.
Repeated violations may also reduce narrative_clarity.

If the page feels dense, it is not ready.

## Packaging Requirements

Each post should include:

- 2–4 pull-quote worthy lines.
- Clear subhead structure aligned to skim behavior.
- Image cadence that prevents long uninterrupted text runs.
- Clear transitions between history, experience, and logistics.

---

## Rating Integrity Requirements

Every verdict must:

- State who it is for.
- State tradeoffs.
- Justify the category clearly.
- Avoid emoji or influencer-style tone.
- Avoid template placeholders.

---

## Distinctiveness
Distinctiveness means:
- Unique observation
- Specific detail
- Perspective not found in generic travel writing
- Personal angle with restraint

Distinctiveness does not require novelty or quirkiness.
It may derive from calibrated restraint, comparative judgment,
or explicit tradeoff analysis uncommon in typical travel writing.

## Launch Readiness Criteria

An article is launch-ready only if:

- Overall score ≥ 8.5
- No dimension < 8.0
- Structural thresholds satisfied
- Packaging violations resolved
- Rating logic explicitly justified

A trip is launch-ready only if:

- Average ≥ 8.7
- No article < 8.5
- No dimension floor violations

Launch is a quality threshold, not a calendar event.

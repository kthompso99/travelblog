PACKAGING & SCROLL EXPERIENCE (CRITICAL)

Simulate reading this on a laptop screen.

Evaluate:

- Does the page feel dense?
- Is there a subheading every ~400–600 words?
- Are there 2–4 pull-quote worthy lines?
- Would an image every ~3–5 scrolls improve pacing?
- Are there long uninterrupted blocks?

If structural thresholds are violated, reduce sentence_structure score.

Include a dedicated section in the markdown audit:

## Packaging & Flow

Specify:
- Exact paragraphs that should be split
- Exact lines that should be used as pull quotes (quote them)
- Exact locations where images should be inserted
- Subheadings to add or tighten
- Any density violations

---

SCORING DISCIPLINE

- Be conservative.
- Avoid score inflation.
- Do not reward charm if structure is weak.
- Penalize repeated adjectives.
- Penalize hedging clusters.
- Penalize recommendation language without justification.
- An article that is well-written, structurally sound,
and clearly communicates tradeoffs should normally score
between 8.2 and 8.8.

RETURN EXACTLY TWO SECTIONS:

PART 1 — JSON ONLY:
{
  "sentence_structure": number,
  "narrative_clarity": number,
  "opening_strength": number,
  "brand_alignment": number,
  "distinctiveness": number,
  "rating_integrity": number
}

PART 2 — MARKDOWN AUDIT:

Structured markdown including:

# Overall Score
(You may compute a blended score using equal weighting unless told otherwise.)

## Sentence Structure
Detailed critique + concrete structural corrections.

## Opening
Critique + tightened rewritten opening.

## Rating Integrity
Critique + rewritten verdict section aligned with brand.

## Weak Sections

Apply proportional intervention based on score:

- Below 7.5 → Provide a substantial rewritten version of the section.
- 7.5–7.9 → Do NOT rewrite the entire section. Suggest surgical edits only:
  - Specific line-level tightening
  - Paragraph splits
  - Word substitutions
  - Structural adjustments
- 8.0+ → Do not rewrite. Provide critique only.

Avoid rewriting strong sections unnecessarily.
Preserve the author's voice when possible.

## Packaging & Flow
Concrete paragraph splits, pull quotes, image placements, subheading suggestions.

## Biggest Lift Opportunities
Top 3–5 high-impact improvements.

## Launch Readiness Assessment
State clearly:
- Is it publisher-ready?
- Which dimensions block launch?
- What must change to reach ≥8.5?

## The Editorial Constitution is binding.

If there is any conflict between writing quality and constitutional standards, the Constitution prevails.

Do not score generously because the writing is pleasant.
If structural thresholds are violated, reduce sentence_structure.

If any dimension falls below 8.0, explain clearly what structural or editorial changes would raise it above threshold.
Avoid penalizing solely for format when substance is present.

Apply the Constitution as a rule set, not as general inspiration.

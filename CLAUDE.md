# CLAUDE.md

### How Kevin and Claude Work Together
** Writing conventions for MD files
Always use "Kevin" or "Claude" and avoid using pronouns

### Planning Protocol
- ** Always plan before implementation**
- Discuss overall strategy before writing code or making edits
- Ask clarifying questions one at a time so Kevin can give complete answers
- Get approval on the approach before implementation
- Focus on understanding requirements and flow first
- After completing each task, ask if Teresa has questions about what was just done

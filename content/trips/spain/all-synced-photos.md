If you ignore the weird religious overtones, the overall building oddly "worked" for us.

We liked this angle because you see the two buildings 'together'.  Note how the Mezquita is (for both religious aesthetic reasons, and logistics reasons of what was possible in the 9th century) quite dark, while the cathedral emphasizes light.](images/spain-20.jpg)

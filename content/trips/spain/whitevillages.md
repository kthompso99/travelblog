### Malaga=\>Ronda

Again, see above where we discuss how [daytrip](http://daytrip.com) allowed us to efficiently see some amazing spots along the way between towns. Between Malaga and Ronda is the wonderful little town of   
Setenil de las Bodegas.  It’s an ancient town, surrounded by cliffs in such a way that parts of the town is built in to the hillside.  An entire block of houses is sheltered under an enormous boulder, another level of houses is built on top of a different insanely-large rock formation.  It’s very instagram-worthy, but overall I think you can see the town in 90 or 120 minutes easily.  This was one time that daytrip was particularly helpful, because our driver could drop us off right at the entrance to the tourist area and pick us up 2 hours later – but parking was a good 15 minute walk away.

This was the last of the 3 [daytrip.com](http://daytrip.com) journeys, and on this one we fit in two different small towns, Grazalema and Zahara de la Sierra.

We spent only 45 minutes in Grazalema but are still glad we went.  It’s more for its atmosphere that it’s famous – it is built into a valley amongst stunning mountains, and it is gorgeously preserved.  We wandered the town some, but had a tight schedule that day so have to admit we largely took pictures from outside the town, of the town nestled into the mountains.  

We loved Zahara de la Sierra.  Like many of the towns in this area, it began as a Moorish outpost due to its strategic position between Ronda and Seville. The town has preserved its medieval labyrinthine urban layout, making it a scenic place to stroll through the narrow streets. It’s maybe a 15-minute walk from the town square up to the top of the tower of the original 13th century castle.  It has been beautifully restored, with the remains of the medieval village still tucked behind its walls. We remarkably had the castle top to ourselves for several minutes – there are stunning views from both the top and on the way up – highly worth it.

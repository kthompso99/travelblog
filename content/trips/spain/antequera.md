![Near the ancient town of Antequera are 3 ancient burial sites. This Dolmen of Menga is believed to be from circa 3700 BC, older than either the Great Pyramids or Stonehenge. The largest stone (not pictured, but on the main roof) is estimated to weigh 200 tons.](images/antequera-01.jpg)

![Tholos de El Romeral is from 1800 BC, so 2000 years "newer" than the previous Dolmen. It shows sophisticated building techniques -- there is no mortar, but the massive stone visible at top wedges all these rocks into place.](images/antequera-02.jpg)

![Atop the town of Antequera is a Moorish fortress, which fell to Castilian forces in 1410. Note the ancient roman rock on the wall to the left and at the base of the tower, then the discontinuity to 14th-century Moorish construction for the top 2/3 of the tower.](images/antequera-03.jpg)

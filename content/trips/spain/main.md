# Southern Spain 2025

Welcome to our trip summary for Southern Spain 2025!

This trip was intended to focus on the former land of Al-Andalus, now known as Andalucia – southern Spain, the area with the densest concentrations of remnants from the centuries of Moorish (Muslim) rule.  We did spend 2-3 nights in Madrid, but only because it’s where the flights landed/departed – our focus was elsewhere, and we hope to return to Madrid some other time to give it its due.

## Trip Overview

This trip was delightful in all ways, but largely for the layers of history.  

### History and Moorish Influence

Do yourself a favor if you haven’t yet and do a basic reading of the Moorish (Muslim) [conquest of the Iberian peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_the_Iberian_Peninsula), starting roughly in the early 8th Century. An interesting aspect of this history for this blog is that the [*Reconquista*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_Reconquista) (re-conquest by Christian forces) played out over *centuries*. Toledo was recaptured in the 12thC, Cordoba in 1236, and Seville in 1248 – but Granada not until 1492\.  Thus, Granada remained under Moorish rule for 250 years longer than Seville and Cordoba, but also interestingly there was a 250-year period where the rulers of Catholic Castilla were at least *somewhat* tolerant of non-Catholics.  You see this in particular in Seville, where the Royal Alcázar (palace) has sections built well into the 13th and 14th centuries (e.g., under Christian rule) that look far more Moorish in design than European. It was only after the final battles of the [*Reconquista*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_Reconquista) in 1492 that Ferdinand and Isabella started the Inquisition, and that tolerance of Muslims on the Iberian peninsula abruptly decreased.  

Still, it’s almost impossible to overstate the influence Moorish rule had over this part of Europe.  Even the Plaza de España in Seville, built in 1929, shows heavy Moorish influence in design. Thus this part of Spain just plain looks different than anywhere else in Europe.

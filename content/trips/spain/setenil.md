![An hour from Malaga lies Setenil de las Bodegas, a small (3000 inhabitants) village famous for homes built into enormous boulders. Cuevas del Sol ("Caves of the Sun") are on the side of the river that gets a moderate amount of sunlight.](images/setenil-01.jpg)

![Cuevas de la Sombra ("Caves of Shadow") lies across the river, in the shade. The size of the boulders over the road are unbelievable.](images/setenil-02.jpg)

![We made a friend in Setenil. I'm pretty sure it wasn't the first time she had had Iberian ham (yes not the healthiest, but she was darn cute).](images/setenil-03.jpg)

## Overview

We visited Madrid for roughly 36 hours each before and after our Andalucian loop, largely because it’s where flights from the US arrive/depart (there were a handful of flights in and out of Seville, but they didn’t have good itineraries by our taste).  By design, we didn’t want to make Madrid the focus, we can return there on another trip and/or early November is not the ideal weather time once you get further north in Spain.



## What We Did

For reasons I’m not clear on, Tuk Tuk tours are ubiquitous in Madrid – we highly recommend one, some of the major ‘sites’ of Madrid are fairly spread out, so in a 3-hour tour we saw a lot more than we would have otherwise.

The Mercado de San Miguel was far from our hotel but near Plaza Mayor.  It is 100% tourist-oriented, but is beautifully housed in a beautiful wrought-iron and glass structure.

The Tuk Tuk took us also to the modern cathedral and the palace, neither of which we entered.

We did make an effort to see several art museums (one before Andalucia, one after).  We visited the Prado, which is The Big Art Museum (analogous to the Louvre), but at the end of a long day and we probably didn’t do it justice – we each had seen it in previous lives and didn’t prioritize it.  We were glad to see a few highlights.  After Andalucia, we visited for the first time the Reina Sofia which is the main modern art museum.  There are several remarkable pieces in there, including some of Dali’s more famous works.  But a common reason to visit is to see Picasso’s Guernica, which each of us thinks we have never seen (though it hung in New York until 1981, Picasso insisted it not display in Spain while Franco lived – so it’s possible I saw it as a child).  As much as I love this piece, and thought I ‘knew’ it, seeing it in person really is stunning.  We were glad to have a guide with us, who could take us left to right and point out details I wasn’t previously aware of.

We also spent an hour or two at the Madrid Archaeological Museum on our last day.  We were pretty tired by then, but it’s an excellent museum, well-displayed and with some stunning pieces from a variety of ancient eras.

![Our last day in Madrid we visited Madrid's National Archeological Museum, which has a vast collection dating back to pre-Roman times. This Lady of Elche -was probably an Iberian funeral urn, but not much is known. It is estimated to be from the 5th century BC, and was found in 1897 by farmers clearing a field.](images/madrid-13.jpg)

## Where We Stayed

We stayed in Madrid twice, both at the beginning and end of our trip.  We deliberately chose different neighborhoods.

After we landed, we stayed at the [Gran Hotel Inglés](https://www.hyatt.com/mr-and-mrs-smith/en-US/m1391-gran-hotel-ingles).  This is an elegant hotel well-situated near many tourist sites, and has a history dating to 1886.  We were very happy for our entire 36 hours there.

The [Hotel Fénix Gran Meliá](https://www.melia.com/en/hotels/spain/madrid/fenix-gran-melia) is in a less-touristy neighborhood a bit further from the tourist district, but still by coincidence a 5-minute walk from the National Archaeological Museum.  Its lobby atrium is gorgeous, and while its history is less deep than the Gran Hotel Inglés, the Beatles and Cary Grant did stay there.....

![Tiffany said I should add this picture as evidence that *sometime* I dress up in Europe. The 1953 lobby of the Hotel Fénix Gran Meliá demanded a bit of effort. Spaniards look so much more put-together, always a scarf or some other adornment. We noticed immediately on landing back on Charlotte how much less stylish Americans are.](images/madrid-14.jpg)

## Practical Tips

Madrid is an enormous city, and its tourist attractions are far more spread out than any of the other cities we visited in Spain.   The Tuk Tuk was a very comfortable way to get around, you feel like you’re a bit more ‘in’ the city than hiding in an SUV, but you can get to different parts of town easily.

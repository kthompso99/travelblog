![Tiffany said I should add this picture as evidence that *sometime* I dress up in Europe. The 1953 lobby of this Madrid hotel (at which both the Beatles and Cary Grant stayed) demanded a bit of effort. Spaniards look so much more put-together, always a scarf or some other adornment. We noticed immediately on landing back on Charlotte how much less stylish Americans are.](images/madrid-13.jpg)

## Overview

Malaga is interesting in that it’s a combination of a cruise ship port (blech), a seaside destination, largely for Brits, but also has interesting historic sites.  We enjoyed it but I wouldn’t call it a highlight compared to the other areas we saw.  But to be fair, the day we arrived was the most old-testament-style rain we experienced in a 3-week trip, which may have colored our experience.

## What We Did

We strolled around the historic center and shopping street, Calle Larios, which is pedestrian-only and worth some time.



The Gibralfaro Castle is far far above town, and we recommend taking a taxi up there rather than walk (the walk *down* was fine).  The castle has an outstanding view of the Mediterranean, but otherwise isn’t that amazing of a destination.

If you walk 15? Minutes ‘down’ from the castle, you arrive at the Alcazaba of Malaga, an 11thC Moorish palace.  We wandered this for maybe an hour or 90 minutes.  It’s quite beautiful, but suffers if you’ve just been to the Alhambra a few days earlier.  Worth the time, and lovely, but not an e-ticket destination of and in itself.

We rented a bike to ride along the seaside.  This was extremely enjoyable and highly recommended.  There are a number of beachside restaurants along the way to stop for a meal or refreshments.

## Where We Stayed

We stayed at [Vincci Larios Diez](https://en.vinccihoteles.com/hotels/malaga/vincci-larios-diez/).  It wasn't terrible, but not our top hotel of the trip; one of the main reasons we booked it was because we were able to get the "Luxe Essence City Views" room, which was indeed lovely -- top floor, corner window, great views.  But the overall hotel experience was "fine".

## Food & Dining

We really enjoyed our meal at [Tercer Acto](https://www.grupoterceracto.com/) [TA](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187438-d19462809-Reviews-Tercer_Acto-Malaga_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andalucia.html) 4.8 near our hotel, it was Japanese fusion – some Iberian ham, some meat, some fish, some sushi, steak tartar, gyoza, meatballs.

## Practical Tips

The downtown area is walking only.  Getting to our hotel wasn't difficult, but was less than pleasant in a horrendous rain storm.

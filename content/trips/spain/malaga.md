## Overview

Malaga is interesting in that it’s a combination of a cruise ship port (blech) and a seaside destination, largely for British expats.  It also has compelling historic sites, but ones that don't quite hold up to Granada or Seville.  We enjoyed it but I wouldn’t call it a highlight compared to the other areas we saw.  To be fair, the day we arrived was the most old-testament-style rain we experienced in a 3-week trip.  This may have colored our experience.

## What We Did

We spent quite a few hours strolling around the historic center and shopping street, Calle Larios.  This is pedestrian-only and worth some time, though like too much of Europe it's filled with the 'standard' brands.  


The Gibralfaro Castle is far far above town, and we recommend taking a taxi up there rather than walk (the walk *down* was fine).  The castle has an outstanding view of the Mediterranean, but otherwise isn’t that amazing of a destination.

If you walk 15 or so minutes 'down' from the castle, you arrive at the Alcazaba of Malaga.  This is an 11thC Moorish palace.  We wandered this for maybe an hour or 90 minutes.  Worth the time, and lovely, but not an e-ticket destination of and in itself.

We rented a bike to ride along the seaside.  This was extremely enjoyable and highly recommended.  A number of beachside restaurants along the way invite you to stop for a meal or refreshments.

## Where We Stayed

We stayed at [Vincci Larios Diez](https://en.vinccihoteles.com/hotels/malaga/vincci-larios-diez/).  This hotel is perfectly adequate, but not our top hotel of the trip.  We booked this hotel largely because we were able to book the "Luxe Essence City Views" room.  This room is indeed lovely, lying on the top floor with a corner window and great views.  But the overall hotel experience was "fine".

## Food & Dining

We really enjoyed our meal at [Tercer Acto](https://www.grupoterceracto.com/) ([TA](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187438-d19462809-Reviews-Tercer_Acto-Malaga_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andalucia.html)) near our hotel.   It featured Japanese fusion – some Iberian ham, some meat, some fish, some sushi, steak tartar, gyoza, meatballs.

## Practical Tips

The downtown area is walking only.  Getting to our hotel wasn't difficult, but was less than pleasant in a horrendous rain storm.

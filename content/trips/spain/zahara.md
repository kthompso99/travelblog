# Zahara de la Sierra



### Ronda=\>Sevilla

This was the last of the 3 [daytrip.com](http://daytrip.com) journeys, and on this one we fit in two different small towns, Grazalema and Zahara de la Sierra.

We spent only 45 minutes in Grazalema but are still glad we went.  It’s more for its atmosphere that it’s famous – it is built into a valley amongst stunning mountains, and it is gorgeously preserved.  We wandered the town some, but had a tight schedule that day so have to admit we largely took pictures from outside the town, of the town nestled into the mountains.  

We loved Zahara de la Sierra.  Like many of the towns in this area, it began as a Moorish outpost due to its strategic position between Ronda and Sevilla. The town has preserved its medieval labyrinthine urban layout, making it a scenic place to stroll through the narrow streets. It’s maybe a 15-minute walk from the town square up to the top of the tower of the original 13th century castle.  It has been beautifully restored, with the remains of the medieval village still tucked behind its walls. We remarkably had the castle top to ourselves for several minutes – there are stunning views from both the top and on the way up – highly worth it.

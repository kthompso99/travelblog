## Overview

Córdoba was supposed to be a box to check.

See the Mezquita. Walk the Roman bridge. Have lunch. Move on.

Instead, it became one of our favorite cities in Europe.

We spent two nights here — and that turned out to be exactly right. Córdoba is compact, atmospheric, and just chaotic enough (directionally speaking) to make wandering feel like an adventure. 

![Beautiful Cordoba was once a Roman city -- this bridge, carrying vehicles until the 1990s, dates from Roman times. Under the Moors, Cordoba was the largest city in Europe in the 9th and 10th Century. Capital of the emirate of Al-Andalus from 756 until its reconquest by the Spanish in 1236, Cordoba grabbed our heart.](images/cordoba-02.jpg)

The Mezquita alone would justify a visit. Staying overnight is what makes it memorable.

> It was our first Andalucía stop outside Madrid, which may have amplified the effect — but even in hindsight, Córdoba stands out. Still, it’s an unusually approachable tourist city.  And to top it off, the Mezquita was one of the most remarkable destinations in Europe.



In general, Cordoba has a very compact ‘old’ city, which is extremely walkable but also extremely easy to get lost in.  One of us (ahem) has a better sense of direction than the other.  Kevin lost his sense of direction repeatedly — but in a compact city like this, you can only wander so far..  The street ‘plan’ is from the Moorish era, and there’s not a single 90 degree turn anywhere.  

While it’s not 100% car-free, the few random taxis are moving quite slowly, so you can just wander, which we loved.

## What We Did

The main attraction of Cordoba, the Mezquita, is one of the most remarkable buildings anywhere.  Mezquita is just Spanish for ‘Mosque’.  Abd al-Rahman I, founder of the Islamic Emirate of Córdoba, ordered it built in 756-757 AD.  After its final expansion in the late 10th century, Mezquita was the second largest mosque in the world for hundreds of years.  Only a mosque in Samarra (modern-day Iraq) was larger, and it now lies largely in ruins.  

The Cordoba Mosque is remarkably well-preserved, but radically altered.  After the 1236 reconquest of Cordoba, the Mezquita was reconsecrated as a Catholic church.  For over two centuries, it remained largely intact, until a major addition of a Cathedral in the 1520s (note, nearly 300 years after the reconquest).  

The Renaissance cathedral arises from right in the middle of the former mosque.  It has gorgeous light and beautiful woodwork, so is stunning in its own right.   The modern result is a unique juxtaposition of two radically different places of worship.  

![The 16th-century Cathedral was built right in the middle of the mosque, thankfully leaving much of the mosque as it was originally. Some criticize the "transition" from one building to the other, but honestly it feels as though it could have been worse, you can see both the mosque arches and bits of the Cathedral in this angle. If you ignore the strangeness of two religions jammed together into one spot, the overall building oddly "worked" for us. We liked this angle because you see the two buildings 'together'.  Note how the Mezquita is (for both religious aesthetic reasons, and logistics reasons of what was possible in the 9th century) quite dark, while the cathedral emphasizes light.](images/cordoba-08.jpg)

We actually thought the combination “could have been worse”.  One could argue that it would be best to have the 8th- and 10th- century mosque 100% intact.  We saw a beautiful effort to harmonize the transition between the 2 buildings, and the cathedral is undeniably a must-see example of Renaissance architecture.

> The entire result was to us fascinating.  We spent two hours in the building and could have spent longer. 

We did not use a private guide for this visit, and cannot decide whether that was the right choice.  We undoubtedly would have learned some extra details by having a guide.  But it's such a special building that just wandering left us time to really absorb the building (mostly) silently, and look for great photos.   

**Bottom Line:** Even if you don’t love religious architecture, this is worth two hours. It’s not just a mosque. It’s not just a cathedral. It’s a layered argument in stone.

![The uncontroversial highlight of Cordoba is the Mezquita (Mosque), built in 785 and then converted into a Cathedral after the reconquest. Various sources indicate it was either the largest or second-largest mosque in the world in the 10th Century. The beautiful arches, over 800 in all, recede endlessly into the distance, creating a beautiful visual.  The archways are original; the hanging lanterns are Christian-added.](images/cordoba-07.jpg)

We started our time in Cordoba with a Rick Steves-recommended 2-hour bike ride around town with [Ontdek Cordoba](https://ontdekcordoba.com/en/).  We highly recommend this; it starts a 15-20 minute walk from the center of town, but it was well worth it.  The guide Francisco is part Dutch but speaks excellent English and is just generally delightful company.  

> Francisco has lived here for over a decade and has been visiting since childhood, which gave him a long-view perspective on how the city has evolved.  He informed us that there were trucks/traffic going over the old Roman bridge as recently as the 1990s.  

Cordoba is a very ‘flat’/bikeable town, with relatively little traffic, so cycling is a great way to learn the overall layout.  The bike ride crosses the river to get to some nice viewpoints of the Mezquita from a distance.  

Note also that many visitors to Cordoba are daytrippers from elsewhere.  As in many European tourist cities, day trippers crowd the walkable old town from roughly 10am to 4pm.  But in the evening the old town really starts to feel like more locals than tourists, to our delight.

![Two tourists on their Cordoba bike tour.](images/cordoba-04.jpg)

We also enjoyed and highly recommend the 8pm-nightly horse show at the Royal Stables of Cordoba.  The horse show in nearby Jerez is more famous, but we didn’t make it to Jerez, and the Cordoba show was delightful.  The show is only 70 minutes or so (including intermission), and very enjoyable.  

We bought the premium pass which cost only an extra \~€8\. We initially bought these tickets through a 3rd-party because Google’s search results pushed me there (shame on me).  However, the 3rd-party site didn’t give the option to select seats or get premium.  If you buy your tickets directly [here](https://cordobaecuestre.com/), you can select premium seats (but those are limited, and disappear weeks in advance, so it’s worth planning). 

> More importantly than the ‘better seats’ is that the premium experience allows you to visit the stables earlier in the day and watch the beautiful horses training. 

It’s only a 5-minute walk from the Mezquita, and was worth a diversion earlier that day.

Cordoba’s Ruta de Patios allows one to see privately-maintained patios that are filled with gorgeous flower arrangements.  In November only a handful were open, but each was unique and quite pretty even off-season.  Evidently these are a point of pride for homeowners, and the competition is fierce for the annual spring competition.  

We saw it as part of our bike tour.  Because these are gardens, the experience varies seasonally.  From what we heard, we would not plan a trip around the May festival crowds, which attracts hundreds of thousands.   Seeing a few patios outside festival season was manageable and charming.

## Where We Stayed

We stayed at the NH Collection Amistad.  This had an excellent location only a few minutes from the Mezquita and right on the edge of the ancient city.  Part of the hotel’s walls are in fact the ancient walls of the medieval city.  

The hotel has only 6 Junior Suites.  We were randomly assigned room 280 — and it turned out to be one of the most atmospheric rooms we’ve ever had.  It has a window carved centuries ago into the ancient wall.  We recommend requesting room 280 if you can, it’s just a cool experience.

Note I say medieval wall, but some of it may be Roman; see this [InfoCordoba site](https://www.infocordoba.com/spain/andalusia/cordoba/city_walls.htm) or this [blog entry](https://anywhereweroam.com/moorish-sites-in-cordoba/)

![Tiffany from outside the wall looking back at our hotel room.  This statue is pretty well known (another cool part of our hotel room).  It depicts 12th-century Cordoban Ibn Rushd, also known as Averroes, who made significant contributions to various fields including philosophy, theology, medicine, and law.](images/cordoba-17.jpg)

## Food & Dining

We found dining in Cordoba pleasant and easy.  

We probably didn't need to make reservations anywhere, but one night we did book ahead at [Restaurant El Rincon de Carmen](https://restauranterincondecarmen.es/).  This restaurant was enjoyable and well worth it -- lovely patio, live performers, great feel all around.

## Practical Tips

The old town is close to the train station, but not close enough to be walking distance; getting a taxi was trivial.  It's a small enough town that Uber is not an option.  Once you're in the old town, everything is very walkable, it's probably 10-15 minutes from one "end" to the other.

![These structures, billed as the world's largest wooden structure, were built in 2011. I love that the architect called them "Metropol Parasol" (umbrellas), but locals almost immediately started calling it Las Setas ("The Mushrooms"). I wonder if they'll be like the Eiffel Tower, which Parisians originally loathed but became one of the landmarks of Sevilla, this structure is on many postcards and the square seems filled with locals.](images/seville-02.jpg)

![The Sevilla Cathedral is the 3rd largest in Europe, and bills itself as the world's largest Gothic cathedral. It is gorgeous from the outside, though the inside is less overwhelming to our taste. The large bell tower is largely a 12th-Century minaret, with only the top 20% being later Christian additions. To walk to the top, there are ramps not stairs so the poor guy who had to do call to prayer 5x daily could ride up the 250+ feet via donkey.](images/seville-03.jpg)

![There a few places where one can see the pipes inside this Moorish wall that carried water to the palace.](images/seville-04.jpg)

![The Plaza de España was built in 1928 for the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929 (which opened just before the world entered the depression -- d'oh). It mixes elements of the Baroque Revival, Renaissance Revival and Moorish Revival styles in a beautiful way.](images/seville-05.jpg)

![The churros are completely unlike what we get in California -- light/airy, and a great breakfast dipped in fresh chocolate.](images/seville-06.jpg)

![Sevilla is an amazing food destination. Bar El Comercio was opened in 1904 and makes fresh churros.](images/seville-07.jpg)

![The unquestionable highlight of Sevilla is the Royal Alcázar (palace), built in stages like most palaces but the best-known part was built in the 1360s. Interestingly it was built *after* the Catholic reconquest, but designed largely in Mudéjar (Moorish) style - under the direction of Christian kings but far more Moorish-looking than otherwise. Parts are comparable to the Alhambra in Granada in beauty.](images/seville-14.jpg)

![Evidently some materials, including columns like this, were repurposed from earlier Roman buildings.](images/seville-16.jpg)

![The gardens behind the palace are immense but tasteful.](images/seville-18.jpg)

![The Sevilla Alcazar served as Dorne in the Game of Thrones. I couldn't figure out where to shoot the scene where Jamie first meets Prince Doran, and the balcony where Doran is murdered doesn't allow photographs, but this serves as a decent placeholder.](images/seville-01.jpg)

![In the Alcazar gardens were quite a few peacocks -- not sure I've ever been quite this close to one (yes, that's my knee).](images/seville-19.jpg)

Ronda is the best-known southern hill town, and is a very common day trip destination because it can be done from Seville or Malaga.  Rick Steves recommended spending a night there, and we’re glad we did.  It’s an enchanting location, with a remarkable 18th-century stone bridge over a yawning gorge, which is beautifully well-lit.  Unlike many of the other small villages, there’s enough infrastructure there and things to see that a night seemed well worth it.

We saw a [Spanish Guitar show](https://www.rondaguitarmusic.com/) the evening we were there, and highly recommend it.  It was only 50-60 minutes, which is just fine (we went 7-8pm and still enjoyed dinner afterwards), and while clearly set up for tourists, we learned quite a bit about different styles of Spanish guitar music.

There is a cave outside of town [Cueva Pileta](https://wagonersabroad.com/ronda-spain-cave/) with ancient (tens of thousands of years old) cave paintings, which I wish we’d made time for, the reviews look amazing but we sorta missed this in planning.

By and large, Ronda is fun just to wander – great views in many places, and enough interesting sites to make it a perfect 24 hours destination.

![The Ronda bridge at night, from our hotel room. If you look closely, you can see hundreds of (mostly) kids lined up for a Halloween haunted mansion of some sort. Halloween is evidently quickly overtaking Day of the Dead as a Spanish holiday. The town center was filled with kids running around, trick-or-treating in the downtown stores.](images/ronda-04.jpg)

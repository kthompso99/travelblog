## Overview 

The **Ruta de los Pueblos Blancos** (Route of the White Villages) is one of Andalusia's most iconic journeys, primarily winding through the south of Spain. These towns are famous for their whitewashed walls—traditionally used to reflect the intense southern sun—and their narrow, winding Moorish streets.  Ronda is the most famous town of the White Villages, so deserves its own page.

## What We Did

Ronda is the best-known southern hill town, and is a very common day trip destination because it can be done from Seville or Malaga.  Rick Steves recommended spending a night there, and we’re glad we did.  It’s an enchanting location, with a remarkable 18th-century stone bridge over a yawning gorge, which is beautifully well-lit.  Unlike many of the other small villages, there’s enough infrastructure there and things to see that a night seemed well worth it.

A path windws down from the old town down to various spots where you can look back at the bridge.  It's confusing where to 'stop'.   Partway down the gorge is a new attraction the [Tagus Gorge](https://desfiladerodeltajo.info/) that we did not pay for. However, as part of that attraction there is an overlook, I think we had to pay 5 euro or similar to get to their viewpoint.  That was lovely -- there are others one "further down" but the day we were there it was plenty hot so we didn't feel the need to go super far down for a better view.

Halloween is evidently quickly overtaking Day of the Dead as a Spanish holiday. The town center was filled with kids running around, trick-or-treating in the downtown stores.](images/ronda-04.jpg)

We saw a [Spanish Guitar show](https://www.rondaguitarmusic.com/) the evening we were there, and highly recommend it.  It was only 50-60 minutes, which is just fine (we went 7-8pm and still enjoyed dinner afterwards), and while clearly set up for tourists, we learned quite a bit about different styles of Spanish guitar music.

A cave outside of town [Cueva Pileta](https://wagonersabroad.com/ronda-spain-cave/) features ancient (tens of thousands of years old) cave paintings.  We wish we'd made time for this, the reviews look amazing but we sorta missed this in planning.

By and large, Ronda is fun just to wander.  Lookouts abound, and there are enough interesting sites to make it a perfect 24 hours destination.

## Where We Stayed

We stayed at [Hotel Montelirio](https://www.hotelmontelirio.com/en/) .  The hotel itself is lovely, but it really pays off for its location -- the view of the gorge and bridge from the rooms (or least the ones we stayed in) was incredible.

## Food & Dining

Our restaurant luck in Ronda was less than perfect, so we have nothing to suggest here.

## Practical Tips

Once you're there, Ronda is very manageable -- not as tiny as Cordoba or even more so as Grazalema, but 10-15 minutes from one end of the tourist zone to the other.  We were happy to have daytrip drop us off, because parking is scarce and you're far from the train lines.

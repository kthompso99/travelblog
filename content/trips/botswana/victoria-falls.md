## Overview

The short Zimbabwe part of our trip exceeded expectations in all ways.  It was both a great introduction to safari life, and Victoria Falls was even more spectacular than we imagined.

We arrived to Victoria Falls by air from Cape Town (after a stop at Kruger airport) to Victoria Falls airport.  A 15-minute car transfer took us, with a brief glimpse at the local town, to a boat dock leading to a lovely 20-minute boat transfer upriver to the Old Drift.  This was a great mellow trip, we didn’t see a lot of animals in that first 20 minutes but it felt like we were ‘in the wild’.

On check-in, we saw an elephant just mellowly munching on tree branches maybe 50 yards from the hotel lobby – quite the intro.  

![This elephant greeted us, 20 yards from the lobby of our Zimbabwe lodge (The Old Drift Inn), immediately as we arrived Saturday afternoon. A strong start.](images/victoria-falls-02.jpg)

We unpacked and then had a delightful 2-3 hour boat safari on the Zambezi – seeing kudu, elephants, a monitor lizard digging a nest, crocodiles, a baby hippo with its parents.  Our guide/captain also knew a great spot on the river to anchor for a gorgeous sunset – lovely end to our first day “in the bush”.

Day 2 our priority was to see Victoria Falls.  Our guides highly recommended an afternoon visit (see below), which meant that for the morning we did our first game (non-boat) drive.  We, or maybe I, had low expectations, but it turns out that the Old Drift Lodge is surrounded by Zambezi National Park.  It’s less “beautiful” than where we went the next week in the Okavango – it’s very dry/dusty – but we saw elephants, giraffes, baboons, and cape buffalo just in that one morning drive.

The afternoon was Victoria Falls.  It was a \~25 minute drive to the park, and then maybe 3 hours of walking.  It’s not long after the start of the hike that you start hearing the rumble – in the local language, the falls are known as Mosi-oa-Tunya, meaning "the smoke that thunders", which sounds way cooler than ‘Victoria”, but also gives a sense of just how insanely powerful and *loud* the falls are.  It's not the world's tallest (that's Angel in Venezuela), or the widest (there are varying candidates), or the highest flow rates (that's on the Congo River further north, and none seem to be as gorgeous, even apart from the visitability of that part of Africa).

![We could include 20 pictures just of the rainbows coming out of the falls. We were not at the highest water time of year (that's Aprilish, end of the rainy season), but I'm glad we saw it when we did in August, since the waterfall was nearly invisible in many spots due to the mist, and evidently that's even more true when the water is higher.](images/victoria-falls-24.jpg)

Regardless, Victoria is generally considered the world's largest overall waterfall combining width and height. It's so huge (over a mile wide) that there's no (non-aerial) vantage point to see all or even much of it. Victoria Falls (as with the Zambezi River) is between Zambia or Zimbabwe; we were on the Zimbabwe side to walk pretty much the entire width of the falls, maybe a mile wide with a good 20 or 30 different viewpoints – none of which see more than maybe 25-30% of the falls.  It’s an incredible experience – Tiffany was moved to tears when we got to the first viewpoint – and the Old Drift was quite correct, at least at that time of year, that the afternoon was perfect because we caught just glorious rainbows coming out of the falls.  

## Where We Stayed

The Old Drift Lodge was excellent in every way.   It lies right on the Zambezi River which only ~10 miles downstream plunges over Victoria Falls.  The Zambezi is a mighty river, the 4th-largest in Africa, and beautiful to look at from both our lodge room and the common area.  We thought of this stop, improperly as it turns out, as “just a place to stay” while visiting Victoria Falls (a 15-minute drive away), but it really was an excellent introduction to African safari life.

The Zambezi is the 4th longest in Africa; our lodge is situated at a narrow(ish?) spot in the river that was used as a ferry crossing in pre-railroad (late 19th century) colonial era.](images/victoria-falls-07.jpg)

It was winter in early August ... Probably 40s when we started in the morning, but 60s by late morning.](images/victoria-falls-14.jpg)

This young male turned to us pretty aggressively when we opened our front door to leave. Later, it was doing not-very-subtle charging behavior towards our friends at the next room over. Staying at a lodge right in an African national park is ... interesting at times.](images/victoria-falls-21.jpg)

Regardless, it is generally considered the world's largest overall waterfall combining width and height. It's so huge (over a mile wide) that there's no (non-aerial) vantage point to see all or even much of it. This is maybe 5% of the falls. But regardless ... Gorgeous.](images/victoria-falls-23.jpg)

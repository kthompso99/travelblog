![Approaching Old Drift for the first time.](images/victoria-falls-01.jpg)

![This elephant greeted us, 20 yards from the lobby of our Zimbabwe lodge (The Old Drift Inn), immediately as we arrived Saturday afternoon. A strong start.](images/victoria-falls-02.jpg)

![Our lodge was on the Zambezi river, and we did a sunset cruise just after arriving. This is a baby hippo learning to swim in the river. The father was nearby and gave a pretty impressive bellow to let us know not to get closer.](images/victoria-falls-04.jpg)

![We saw this male monitor lizard digging an egg hole for its mate right next to the river.](images/victoria-falls-05.jpg)

![The largest croc we saw from our boat. We were as close as we wanted to be.](images/victoria-falls-06.jpg)

![Kevin enjoying the Sunday morning sunrise (6:10am or so) on the Zambezi river, looking across to Zambia. The Zambezi is the 4th longest in Africa; our lodge is situated at a narrow(ish?) spot in the river that was used as a ferry crossing in pre-railroad (late 19th century) colonial era.](images/victoria-falls-07.jpg)

![Sunday morning game ride featured more elephants than we can count. This juvenile is learning to flap its ears to look threatening and make sure we don't get closer.](images/victoria-falls-08.jpg)

![The giraffes we saw in Zimbabwe were just a tiny bit blocked by the branches, but the golden-hour (~8am) light on them was gorgeous.](images/victoria-falls-11.jpg)

![We had a surprise coffee break towards the end of our morning game drive right on the Zambezi river. I asked our guide why it was safe to be standing next to a crocodile- and hippo-infested river, and am not sure the answer was satisfactory, but .... it was lovely.

It was winter in early August ... Probably 40s when we started in the morning, but 60s by late morning.](images/victoria-falls-14.jpg)

![Baobab trees were plentiful in Zambezi national park.](images/victoria-falls-15.jpg)

![Not sure if this baboon was showing us her best side, but the baby sure was cute. Baboons travel in troops ... probably a few dozen in this one.](images/victoria-falls-16.jpg)

![The Old Drift staff used non-lethal slingshots to keep this monkey from begging "too" much at meals.](images/victoria-falls-18.jpg)

![This is from the front porch of our lodge room .  We needed to leave our room to get back to the main lodge building early this afternoon .... but decided to wait, maybe just a little while. 

This young male turned to us pretty aggressively when we opened our front door to leave. Later, it was doing not-very-subtle charging behavior towards our friends at the next room over. Staying at a lodge right in an African national park is ... interesting at times.](images/victoria-falls-21.jpg)

![The most common reason to come to this part of Zimbabwe is to see Victoria Falls. It's not the world's tallest (that's Angel in Venezuela), or the widest (varying candidates), or the highest flow rates (that's on the Congo River further north).

Regardless, it is generally considered the world's largest overall waterfall combining width and height. It's so huge (over a mile wide) that there's no (non-aerial) vantage point to see all or even much of it. This is maybe 5% of the falls. But regardless ... Gorgeous.](images/victoria-falls-23.jpg)

![We could include 20 pictures just of the rainbows coming out of the falls. We were not at the highest water time of year (that's Aprilish, end of the rainy season), but I'm glad we saw it when we did in August, since the waterfall was nearly invisible in many spots due to the mist, and evidently that's even more true when the water is higher.](images/victoria-falls-24.jpg)

![This spot in particular was drenching.…](images/victoria-falls-25.jpg)

![Probably less than a mile from arriving back at our Zimbabwe lodge, saw a few dozen elephants crossing right in front of our van.](images/victoria-falls-26.jpg)

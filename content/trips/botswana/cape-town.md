## Overview

We wanted to see Cape Town, which some think is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, but August isn’t the best time to visit there since it’s winter (think San Francisco winter, not Chicago winter).  This trip optimized for "best time to visit the Okavango" rather than "best time to visit Cape Town".  There can evidently be some pretty fierce winter storms coming off the ocean, we got lucky, one rainy day but only for a few hours, and some drizzle.  

### What We Did

We *did* go to the District 6 Museum, we did *not* go to to Robbyn Island, famously one of several prisons where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned (1964-1982).  Several people, including Kili from Next Adventure, suggested that Robbyn Island is a big trip – sorta a 6-hour trip end-to-end (waiting for the boat, the boat trip, etc) … to have your 3 minutes in front of Mandela’s cell, and that it may or may not be worth the overhead.  Evidently in the past the tour guides would be former prisoners, and 10-15 years ago you might have anecdotes of people who knew the great man … now much less so since time marches on.  I read one TripAdvisor review in which the young tour guide made vaguely racist jokes *on Robbyn Island* … blech.

However, we found the District 6 museum compelling – it’s not huge, it’s a 90-120 minute sort of visit, but well worth it.  District 6 was an entire mixed-race neighborhood that the apartheid government just decided to empty and then bulldoze in the 1960s, because it was too close to white areas.  The stories told are compelling, and we found it affecting.  Interestingly, there was a tour guide there while we were there who was a resident of that neighborhood in the 1960s … our tour guide was the child of two District 6 residents.  Generally very recommended, and book a tour in advance, I think they were sold out the day we were there (not to visit the museum, but for the guided tours).

We thoroughly enjoyed [**GOLD**](https://goldrestaurant.co.za/) for an evening show.  We thought it was ‘just’ dinner, but it’s really a full-on dinner theater, probably a 90-minute show with multi-course African-themed food.  It’s 100%, absolutely, something for tourists … but it was/is extremely well-executed.  The performers had infectious energy, and the food was excellent.  Per security comments above … they had a Gold staff member escort us the 30 \*feet\* to our Uber.  

A standard thing to do, but we highly recommend it, is a day-long Cape Peninsula tour.  Doing the full loop down the west coast, over Chapman’s Peak drive, down all the way to Cape Point, and then back is probably 3ish hours of more of straight driving, but it ends up being quite a bit of a day given all the stops for photo opps, short walks, etc.  We wouldn’t recommend our vendor, as our driver was casually racist in a way we didn’t love, but any number of companies do this tour if you web-search.  Our friend who did it a year before us drove it herself, and wished she’d had a driver, and we were happy we did, as some of the driving is on narrow hairpin-y roads (on the left hand side of the road, of course).  The penguins on Boulder Beach are adorable (and sadly quite endangered).  We had a lovely lunch out at Cape Point at Two Oceans Restaurant, it was better than expected for a touristy spot, it worked well.

A standard Cape Town recommendation is to ascend Table Mountain on the gondola.  That works, except … it closes for 4 days every year for maintenance and …. We drew the short straw.  So we can’t tell you how that is.  Many guidebooks recommend you schedule it for your first day because the weather is so unpredictable – and then you can postpone it if it's cloudy.  We certainly had quite a bit of time from Cape Town in which we couldn’t see the top of the mountain.

Kirstenbosch is the oldest botanical garden in South Africa.  It’s a 15 or 20 minute drive from the Central Business District, sorta “behind” Table Mountain, but a (beautiful) world apart.  It’s to our mind well worth 2 or 3 hours of your time in Cape Town.  I think the best or only trails to the top of Table Mountain actually start near here, on the ‘back’ (less table-shaped) side of Table Mountain.  We visited Kirstenbosch guided by the wonderful [Christopher Smith](https://tablemountain.my-hiking.com/), who was recommended to us by a friend who visited Kirstenbosch in 2024\.  He can be reached at Whatsapp \+27 83 699 6661\.  His website will show that one of his main passions is hiking, and he takes groups up Lion’s Head and Table Mountain (not something my knees can accommodate these days).  But he is also extremely passionate about plants, and was wonderful company for those several very informative hours, and took some excellent photos.

The [Constantia Valley](https://constantiawineroute.com/) is a small and venerable wine region found right on the southern outskirts of Cape Town; this is distinct from the Cape Winelands (below) which are north and east of town (and further away).  We were able to visit [Groot Costantia](https://grootconstantia.co.za/), a winery that dates to the 17th century, on our way back from our Cape Peninsula tour, it’s also 10 minutes from Kirstenbosch and 22 minutes from the Mt Nelson so in retrospect we could have planned differently.  This turned out to be one of the best wineries we visited in South Africa, and we sort of wish we’d ordered some from there but didn’t know at the time because it was the first South African winery we visited.  It’s run as a non-profit, to preserve South Africa’s wine heritage; I feel as though its wines may be under-priced for their quality in retrospect.  Excellent stop, highly recommended.

## Where We Stayed

We stayed at the [Mount Nelson](https://www.belmond.com/hotels/africa/south-africa/cape-town/belmond-mount-nelson-hotel/), a venerable 1899 hotel with notable past guests including Winston Churchill, Queen Elizabeth, and John Lennon.  We found it outstanding in every way, a lovely spot to relax after 20 hours of flying and before heading out to safari.  We had 2 dinners there and each was excellent, we especially recommend Chef’s Table if you stay there, it’s a special experience within the kitchen.

It’s always tricky to talk about safety, as different people have different experiences and/or risk profiles.  We booked a dinner one night at the [Kloof Street House](https://www.kloofstreethouse.co.za/), which is about 500 yards from the hotel – and the hotel insisted on having a staff member escort us there due to perceived risk (they said daytime didn’t worry them).  Is this overkill?  It’s so hard to know.  We (Kevin) did have a non-violent but non-pleasant experience during that 500 yards where a clearly-not-sober individual yelled at Kevin (who had not said a word) with some form of “figures, it’s a white guy” (the speaker was not) – but that could probably happen anywhere.  We have a friend who visited Cape Town in 2023, stayed in an AirbnB near Kloof St, and didn’t feel all that unsafe.  All that being said – if the hotel feels that paranoid, it’s not a great feeling.  So the Mt Nelson felt like an oasis – but not one from which we were confident we can venture out safely at night.  Note that Uber worked quite well in town, and is absurdly cheap ($3 or $4 for a ride), which does help a lot.

There’s a section of Cape Town known as the “V\&A Waterfront” (Victoria & Albert).  This is where the cruise ships dock (not in August, but in general), and is an enclosed, highly sanitized section with security in a great deal of evidence – vs a lot of the rest of town where police were certainly not highly visible.  Many hotels are in the V\&A section, and there are quite a few lovely hotels – we’re not necessarily sad we didn’t stay there, but it would have been nice to be able to just get out and walk without quite as much security concerns, perceived or otherwise, around it.  We did have a great lunch at the Time Out Market in V\&A.

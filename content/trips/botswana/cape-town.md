![This sign greets you at Cape Town airport.  Some 1930s newspaper article it "The Mother City" as the original colony of Southern Africa, I'm not clear whether all ethnic groups find the moniker equally delightful.](images/cape-town-01.jpg)

![The District 6 Museum tells the harrowing story of apartheid from the microcosm of a single neighborhood. The government decided in 1966 that this district of Cape Town should be designated whites-only, and forcibly removed 60,000 people from a thriving community. Our guide was the child of a couple who were amongst those dislocated.

In the back of this main hall are street signs rescued from the neighborhood.](images/cape-town-02.jpg)

![There's something about being right in front of an actual sign from the era that is searing.](images/cape-town-03.jpg)

![We saw an African cultural show at Gold Restaurant our first night. Sure it was/is for tourists, but the energy was infectious, and the food was tasty.](images/cape-town-04.jpg)

![South Africa hosts a variety of sunbirds, these ones really stood out.](images/cape-town-08.jpg)

![Bo-Kaap is a non-white Cape Town neighborhood that was not destroyed by apartheid (it's not quite clear why), and still has colorful homes that please the eye.](images/cape-town-13.jpg)

![This Southern Fur Seal (found in Hout Bay, 30 minutes south) is fed by hawkers trying to charge tourists for a photo, and is overly comfortable with humans ... but is still pretty impressive to see.](images/cape-town-14.jpg)

![Tiffany noticed how different the bouquets are in South Africa.](images/cape-town-15.jpg)

![One can travel 10,000 miles and still not get away from US news..... the tariffs were a source of great consternation based on how many asked us about them.](images/cape-town-16.jpg)

![Baboons in Table Mountain National Park.  They crossed right in front of our vehicle, with one male taking the time (not pictured) to copulate in mid-street-crossing.](images/cape-town-17.jpg)

![We've seen ostriches in the wild, we've seen oceanfronts. The combination was quite novel.](images/cape-town-20.jpg)

![The Cape of Good Hope marked the spot where early Portuguese travellers could start travelling more east than south on their way to Asia.

The line to get The Picture of us behind the sign was longer than felt worth it to us.](images/cape-town-21.jpg)

![African penguins at Boulders Beach, about an hour from Cape Town.  They are sadly highly endangered.](images/cape-town-22.jpg)

![African penguins are small but entertaining to watch.  This colony at Boulder Beach is extremely accessible.  

Sadly, at the Two Oceans Aquarium in Cape Town they warned us that African penguins may not make it past the 2030s.  Too much food disappearing.](images/cape-town-23.jpg)

![This hyrax near Boulder's Beach looked well-fed.](images/cape-town-24.jpg)

![It's not quite clear to us why someone decide that beach changing rooms should be so colorful, but they're definitely social-media-friendly.  These were in or near Muizenberg on False Bay.  Winter so no action.](images/cape-town-25.jpg)

![As much as it's in every tourist guide for Cape Town, it's difficult to overestimate how much Table Mountain *looms* over the central district.  We had quite a bit of cloud cover, but one day where the view was perfect.

Sadly, they close the gondola up the mountain 5 days a year for maintenance.  Guess which days we were there?](images/cape-town-26.jpg)

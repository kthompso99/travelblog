## Overview

Sable Alley was/is the more ‘affordable’ of our 2 camps.   It was/is hardly roughing it – see our bedroom.  Note that the outside is all canvas, but there are wooden structures inside framing a perfectly modern-feeling bathroom with sinks, flush toilets, and a full shower (as well as an outdoor shower – showering in the open staring at hippos is definitely memorable, hopefully not for the hippos).

![This shows what things were like at our first Okavango lodge, where the floods were in full force.  A view of the 'road' covered in water.  It was typically 1-2 feet deep, though we had some deeper crossings.](images/sable-alley-09.jpg)

![All 3 guides we had across 2 countries made the same joke that the nickname for Impala was "McDonalds" because you can see them everywhere.  And we did see them, at least 5-10 times a day.  But they're not unattractive antelope.](images/sable-alley-10.jpg)

![This was our first view at the Sable Alley leopard sighting, which lasted a good 40 minutes overall.](images/sable-alley-11.jpg)

![One of many incredible sunsets we captured; the profile of the trees against the near-equatorial sun was magical. This one was at the tail end of a river trip on the Khwai river near Sable Alley, our first Okavango camp.  Note hippos in the foreground to the left.](images/sable-alley-20.jpg)

![It amuses me to look back at my first (Zimbabwe) reactions to see how I was excited to have seen elephants. In the Okavango, elephants were *everywhere*, to the point that our friends and we were joking about the "elusive elephant" on our 25th sighting of the day late in the trip.

Usually the older adults ignore the trucks and just keep eating, and one young male will do a lot of mock-charging and ear flapping to ensure we know to take him seriously.](images/sable-alley-27.jpg)

![We don't have the one photo that captures it perfectly, but we were literally in the middle of a herd of dozens of elephants on our last morning game drive of Sable Alley.  End of the morning drive (see camp in the background), they were coming from the left towards the water on the right, and they just kept coming.](images/sable-alley-28.jpg)

![The same herd of elephants from camp -- everyone was envious that we had been right in the middle of it.](images/sable-alley-29.jpg)

![At all three of our camps over the 9 days in the bush, we had elephants right in camp. This is one behind a Sable Alley lunch table to give perspective of how close they were.](images/sable-alley-30.jpg)

![Notice two zebras nose-to-tail, keeping sentry duty](images/sable-alley-32.jpg)

![Note the brown stripes intermixed with the black -- our guide told us this is a genetic thing, I haven't looked it up.](images/sable-alley-33.jpg)

![At our first Okavango camp we saw relatively few zebra until the last day, when we captured this shot.  At our second camp zebra were everywhere. 

I wish we understood the dynamics better; in Tanzania (the Serengeti) you see hundreds of wildebeest and a handful of zebra. In the parts of the Okavango we spent the longest time in, there were sizable zebra herds (but dozens, not hundreds), and only a handful of wildebeest. I fear the answer is some fences used to "protect" livestock nearby.](images/sable-alley-34.jpg)

![This baboon was clearly enjoying his lunch.  We think it was a male but can't be sure.](images/sable-alley-35.jpg)

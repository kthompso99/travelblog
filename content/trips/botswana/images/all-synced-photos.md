Regardless, it is generally considered the world's largest overall waterfall combining width and height. It's so huge (over a mile wide) that there's no (non-aerial) vantage point to see all or even much of it. This is maybe 5% of the falls. But regardless ... Gorgeous.](images/victoria-falls-23.jpg)

The parts of the Okavango we visited featured much more heavy vegetation, and while the animals were incredible they were more sparse than in the Serengeti.

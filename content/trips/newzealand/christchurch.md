## Overview

Christchurch was devastated by 2 earthquakes in 2011, and it’s quite astonishing how much it still shows.  Don’t get us wrong, they’ve done a magnificent job rebuilding, but you can still see the scars.  Some of the downtown is just buildings and empty lots – but one thing we learned is that the historical downtown of Christchurch is built on swampy landfill, which is why the earthquake was so devastating.  So … for those who have the resources, many moved away – evidently a good xx% of Christchurch residents moved from downtown to what used to be a suburb 20? miles away (one we did not visit).  You just felt it walking around – downtown Churchill isn’t exactly empty, but at the same time it doesn’t feel thriving either.  Net/net – few recommend it as a highlight, and we wouldn’t disagree (though we found two great restaurants, see above).  Manu in particular is doing some sort of indigenous/pan-Asian fusion, and was awesome.

Why we stayed in Christchurch is because Kevin is obsessed with Tolkien (a recurring theme), and the all-day tour out to Edoras was \*outstanding\* if you’re into it.  Really get a sense of place, it’s such a spectacular spot that even Tiffany (who has managed to basically never see the movies) thought it was an enjoyable day.

## Overview

Christchurch was devastated by 2 earthquakes in 2011, and it’s quite astonishing how much it still shows.  Don’t get us wrong, they’ve done a magnificent job rebuilding, but you can still see the scars everywhere.  Some of the downtown is just buildings and empty lots – but one thing we learned is that the historical downtown of Christchurch is built on swampy landfill, which is why the earthquake was so devastating.  So … for those who have the resources, many moved away – evidently a good xx% of Christchurch residents moved from downtown to what used to be a suburb 20? miles away (one we did not visit).  You just felt it walking around – downtown Churchill isn’t exactly empty, but at the same time it doesn’t feel thriving either.  Net/net – few recommend it as a highlight, and we wouldn’t disagree (though we found two great restaurants, see above).  Manu in particular is doing some sort of indigenous/pan-Asian fusion, and was awesome.

Street artists started painting after the earthquake.

Why we stayed in Christchurch is because Kevin is obsessed with Tolkien (a recurring theme), and the all-day tour out to Edoras was \*outstanding\* if you’re into it.  Really get a sense of place, it’s such a spectacular spot that even Tiffany (who has managed to basically never see the movies) thought it was an enjoyable day.

This sculpture was placed outdoors after the local art gallery was shut due to earthquake damage, was a public favorite and became a symbol of hope after the devastating earthquakes.](images/christchurch-07.jpg)

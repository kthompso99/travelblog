## Overview

It was interesting, many NZ locals sorta recommended against Rotorua – saying it was ‘run down’ and ‘smelly’ (there is a faint sulfur smell near some of the volcanic ruins) – we found it outstanding, but we’re into geothermal features.

If one reads a history of NZ, in the late 19thC Europeans were almost entirely near the coast, and the Maori retreated to the inland areas.  Rotorua was a center of Maori culture and remains so, and it’s noticeable on the streets that many more Maori remain there than in Wellington/Auckland/Christchurch/Queenstown.

We did 2 main adventures:

* Waimangu Volcanic Valley: Waimangu Thermal Reserve Self Guided Walk and Boat Cruise – very enjoyable.  This is one of the newest (maybe the newest?) geothermal areas on earth, there was a volcano eruption in 1886 that buried a Maori village.  Gorgeous boiling lakes, and the boat trip was very pleasant.  
* One evening: Te Po \- Indigenous Evening Experience with Hangi Dinner Buffet.  The Dinner buffet was very ‘ok’.  I wish we’d done this differently.  They have cultural exhibits in the afternoon that we missed, but First Light booked us for the evening, which was a long dinner.  That being said, there was an impressive Maori dance performance before the dinner that was entertaining.

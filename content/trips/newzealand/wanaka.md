## Overview

First Light recommended we drive to Wanaka and spend 2 nights there, then go to Queenstown.  We decided we wanted to hop less and focus more.  We drove all the way from Franz Josef to Queenstown – that’s a longgg day, almost 6 hours of driving, but given that it meant more time in Queenstown we have no regrets.  Worth waking up early to do this drive gradually, there are gorgeous beaches (though be careful of biting flies\! Deet up).

The Haast visitor center was a great pit stop.

The town of Wanaka is a great stop, there are a bunch of restaurants on the lake, plus (see above) Rippon winery.  We enjoyed 2 hours there.

![Rippon Winery on the southern edge of Lake Wanaka has been named the most beautiful winery in the world by more than one writer. That's a crazy thing to say about a single winery of tens of thousands, but it is an incredible setting. And the Pinot Noir ain't bad.](images/wanaka-07.jpg)

![The Rippon tasting is weirdly short -- 30 minutes -- and the wine alone wouldn't merit a detour.  Makes for a great photo though.](images/wanaka-08.jpg)

# New Zealand



The South Island is nuts.  Consistently gorgeous, wild, woolly (very sparsely populated) – if you have a vision from a helicopter in Lord of the Rings of incredible NZ, you’re imagining in the South Island.  We can’t recommend it enough, especially Queenstown which we completely fell in love with.

The North Island is very attractive, and there are large swaths of it we didn't see, especially the far north “Bay of Islands” which many travellers we met said was quite pretty, and quite a few people mentioned Coromandel only 1-2 hours from Auckland. That being said … it was a bit anticlimactic after the South.  Wellington is a cute city; maybe Auckland has a charm, but mostly Auckland seems just kinda ‘big city’ (with a great harbor to be sure, worth a day)

* We loved this couple (I think from Auckland) and their YT videos, e.g. [Daneger & Stacey South Island Top 10](https://youtu.be/qsR5pKmAId4?si=myh3_KMZg_chC6o7), and many others, esp in Queenstown.   More informative, less “gosh my girlfriend looks hot in a bikini” than most YT travel videos.  

We hired a company First Light Travel to ‘organize it’.  I have no complaints per se – they scheduled a lot of it so it was less hassle for us, they had the hotels and ferries ready and picked very solid hotels – but I think we probably overpaid for it.  The fact is, most of NZ you drive – things are spread out, our route from Christchurch to Auckland is like driving from Portland to San Diego, but on 2-lane (1 each way) roads where you’re driving 45 MPH not 70\.  

Our original itinerary had us driving ‘all’ of it, except for the flight from Nelson (South Island) to Wellington (North).  First Light said the ferry had been having lots of issues in recent years, and the weather was unpredictable – but we also have friends who recently did it and said the 3-hour trip was lovely.  Not sure.

We also chose to be semi-lazy and fly 2 routes to save driving:

* From Queenstown to Christchurch – this was/is still controversial to us. We saved 6 hours driving this way, but missed Mt Cook area which may have been a mistake, given how much we came to realize how gorgeous the Southern Alps are.  I wish I’d done the Hooker Valley track.  
* We flew from Wellington to Rotorua, skipping a 5.5 hour drive.  This one seems more worth ‘flying’ – but we missed driving by Mt Doom, the volcanic park on the North Island.  Not sure whether that was a big miss or not, but there’s plenty of driving.  
* This of course also meant we rented a car 4 separate times on our trip – you may or may not decide that’s not worth saving some driving.

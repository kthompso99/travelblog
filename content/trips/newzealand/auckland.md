## Overview

Most NZ locals won’t recommend Auckland – it’s big, it doesn’t have a lot of pretty old buildings, it sprawls a lot – it sorta had a Los Angeles vibe to me.  We didn’t hate it, but 3 nights was definitely more than is required.

Hotel Britomart was far from our favorite hotel – the rooms were just tiny to the point of claustrophobia.  Nice location though.

We thought Waiheke was delightful – very pretty island, even just the ferry ride is lovely, and there are quite a few excellent wineries once there (see ‘Wine’ section above).

Wandering the harbor was fun – Auckland is where a lot of the NZ yachting community is, you see one of their America’s Cup boats (and can I think ride in one, though we didn’t do that).

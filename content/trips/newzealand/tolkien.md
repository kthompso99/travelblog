[This LoTR location map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1eP5buUDEub3nenZfEVWbfWoktxz22cF9&g_ep=CAESCTExLjkzLjMwNhgAIN1iKhI0NzA2ODYxNSwsNDcwNzU5MTVCAk5a&shorturl=1&ll=-41.5090390930449%2C172.05929585000004&z=6) is incredible, the single best one I found.    
Edoras and Hobbiton are very worth it as 1-offs – meaning great location, but just one location with nothing else near it.  We thought Edoras in particular was incredible.  
Queenstown is Tolkien central – Isengard, Ithilien, Amon Hen (on the driveway towards the Rosewood), Rohan, the mountains above Minas Tirith, are all there.  We did it on our own using the map, but at at least one spot (Ithilien) I bumbled around looking for the right spot and then saw a van take a tour right to the correct spot of the hobbits seeing the Oliphaunts … maybe a guided tour is the right choice to see the highlights.  Queenstown heights (Rohan, the Warg battle) is worth the drive, the views are great even if you aren’t a Tolkien nut.

Wellington is where the WETA studios are, and also where some of the first Shire filming was done (“Get Off the Road” as the Black Riders appear).  Well worth a half-day tour.  
We flew past Mordor, so can’t answer whether it’s exciting to see the volcano.

![Amon Hen was right on the short of Lake Wakatipu, which is near Queenstown.  Some location guides said the location is on private land, so it's possible the spot I photographed is near, not exactly, where Amon Hen is, but the background sure looks right.](images/tolkien-01.jpg)

![The hobbits hid from the black rider in a park right near downtown Wellington.  The tree root they hide underneath is a total prop, but you can see the tree roots in the background line up.](images/tolkien-04.png)

![This is the valley where Isengard lies ... we ran out of time to get super close, but evidently to have the right 'view' that looks like where the wizard's vale is, you need to be on private land.](images/tolkien-12.jpg)

![Welcome to the North Island!  These eagles were installed in 2013 for the Hobbit, and taken down just 3 months after our January 2025 visit so we feel fortunate.](images/tolkien-13.jpg)

![Edoras is a multi-hour van ride from Christchurch, but we thought it was worth it.  The site is such an incredibly evocative location, and all the wind you see in the movies was easy to "imagine".](images/tolkien-17.jpg)

![TIffany is on the ridge where Gandalf rode towards Minas Tirith.  This is also near the warg attack.  The gorgeous mountains in the background were The Remarkables.](images/tolkien-18.jpg)

![The spot where Aragorn falls off the cliff .... is a perfect viewing point for Queenstown airport.  All about the angles.](images/tolkien-19.jpg)

![Deer Park Heights right near Queenstown was where they filmed many scenes: the warg attack, the spot where the Rohan refugees walk away from Edoras, where Gandalf rides towards Minas Tirith .... Peter Jackson obviously loved it.](images/tolkien-20.jpg)

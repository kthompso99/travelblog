[This LoTR location map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1eP5buUDEub3nenZfEVWbfWoktxz22cF9&g_ep=CAESCTExLjkzLjMwNhgAIN1iKhI0NzA2ODYxNSwsNDcwNzU5MTVCAk5a&shorturl=1&ll=-41.5090390930449%2C172.05929585000004&z=6) is incredible, the single best one I found.    
Edoras and Hobbiton are very worth it as 1-offs – meaning great location, but just one location with nothing else near it.  We thought Edoras in particular was incredible.  
Queenstown is Tolkien central – Isengard, Ithilien, Amon Hen (on the driveway towards the Rosewood), Rohan, the mountains above Minas Tirith, are all there.  We did it on our own using the map, but at at least one spot (Ithilien) I bumbled around looking for the right spot and then saw a van take a tour right to the correct spot of the hobbits seeing the Oliphaunts … maybe a guided tour is the right choice to see the highlights.  Queenstown heights (Rohan, the Warg battle) is worth the drive, the views are great even if you aren’t a Tolkien nut.

Wellington is where the WETA studios are, and also where some of the first Shire filming was done (“Get Off the Road” as the Black Riders appear).  Well worth a half-day tour.  
We flew past Mordor, so can’t answer whether it’s exciting to see the volcano.

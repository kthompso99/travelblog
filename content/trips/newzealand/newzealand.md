* We loved this couple (I think from Auckland) and their YT videos, e.g. [Daneger & Stacey South Island Top 10](https://youtu.be/qsR5pKmAId4?si=myh3_KMZg_chC6o7), and many others, esp in Queenstown.   More informative, less “gosh my girlfriend looks hot in a bikini” than most YT travel videos.  

We hired a company First Light Travel to ‘organize it’.  I have no complaints per se – they scheduled a lot of it so it was less hassle for us, they had the hotels and ferries ready and picked very solid hotels – but I think we probably overpaid for it.  The fact is, most of NZ you drive – things are spread out, our route from Christchurch to Auckland is like driving from Portland to San Diego, but on 2-lane (1 each way) roads where you’re driving 45 MPH not 70\.  

Our original itinerary had us driving ‘all’ of it, except for the flight from Nelson (South Island) to Wellington (North).  First Light said the ferry had been having lots of issues in recent years, and the weather was unpredictable – but we also have friends who recently did it and said the 3-hour trip was lovely.  Not sure.

We also chose to be semi-lazy and fly 2 routes to save driving:

* From Queenstown to Christchurch – this was/is still controversial to us. We saved 6 hours driving this way, but missed Mt Cook area which may have been a mistake, given how much we came to realize how gorgeous the Southern Alps are.  I wish I’d done the Hooker Valley track.  
* We flew from Wellington to Rotorua, skipping a 5.5 hour drive.  This one seems more worth ‘flying’ – but we missed driving by Mt Doom, the volcanic park on the North Island.  Not sure whether that was a big miss or not, but there’s plenty of driving.  
* This of course also meant we rented a car 4 separate times on our trip – you may or may not decide that’s not worth saving some driving.

### Big Picture

The South Island is nuts.  Consistently gorgeous, wild, woolly (very sparsely populated) – if you have a vision from a helicopter in Lord of the Rings of incredible NZ, you’re imagining in the South Island.  We can’t recommend it enough, especially Queenstown which we completely fell in love with.

The North Island is very attractive, and there are large swaths of it we didn't see, especially the far north “Bay of Islands” which many travellers we met said was quite pretty, and quite a few people mentioned Coromandel only 1-2 hours from Auckland. That being said … it was a bit anticlimactic after the South.  Wellington is a cute city; maybe Auckland has a charm, but mostly Auckland seems just kinda ‘big city’ (with a great harbor to be sure, worth a day) 

### Wine

Those who know us won’t be surprised that we sampled wines at a number of places:

* Wanaka – there is a single winery right on Lake Wanaka called ‘Rippon’ that some magazine said was the most beautiful winery in the world.  I think no one winery can reasonably claim that … but it sure is gorgeous.  Weirdly rushed tasting (30 minutes???, ok but not great wine), but still an enjoyable detour for the Instagram moments.  
* The Central Otago region is 45 minutes outside of Queenstown.  They make very well-crafted Pinot Noirs (we were especially impressed by Vallee), but they’re not quite our style – very ‘big’ Pinots, a bit more fruit-forward than is our preference.  Pretty country.  
* We were told to skip Marlborough because it’s mostly huge wineries using robotic picking, but ended up visiting one winery because it was on the way from Kaikoura to Nelson.  It was delightful, and we wonder if we should have spent more time there.  
* We didn’t really ‘taste’ up in Nelson, but at one dinner we happened to have a Nelson Pinot Noir and it was actually one of our favs of the trip – maybe due to low (as in, 0, because I didn’t know there was such a thing as Nelson Pinot Noir) expectation.    
* We did a day trip to Martinborough, 1.5? Hours from Wellington.  Beautiful drive over a mountain pass (and Rivendell is on the way, if you’re a Tolkien nut).  Much smaller/quieter than some of the other regions, some excellent tastings (still cool climate enough that it’s Pinot/Chardonnay), very friendly, sorta ‘80s Sonoma feel.  
* Waiheke is an island maybe 40 minute ferry from Auckland.  Very pretty, lovely, and some excellent wines from a warmer region – Kennedy Point in particular makes a Syrah that’s won a bunch of awards, and was quite lovely.  
* And yes, we missed Hawke’s Bay.  Supposed to be great, just didn’t quite make our itinerary.

### Tolkien

[This LoTR location map](https://bit.ly/3WnLMfg) is incredible, the single best one I found.    
Edoras and Hobbiton are very worth it as 1-offs – meaning great location, but just one location with nothing else near it.  We thought Edoras in particular was incredible.  
Queenstown is Tolkien central – Isengard, Ithilien, Amon Hen (on the driveway towards the Rosewood), Rohan, the mountains above Minas Tirith, are all there.  We did it on our own using the map, but at at least one spot (Ithilien) I bumbled around looking for the right spot and then saw a van take a tour right to the correct spot of the hobbits seeing the Oliphaunts … maybe a guided tour is the right choice to see the highlights.  Queenstown heights (Rohan, the Warg battle) is worth the drive, the views are great even if you aren’t a Tolkien nut.

Wellington is where the WETA studios are, and also where some of the first Shire filming was done (“Get Off the Road” as the Black Riders appear).  Well worth a half-day tour.  
We flew past Mordor, so can’t answer whether it’s exciting to see the volcano.

### Christchurch

Christchurch was devastated by 2 earthquakes in 2011, and it’s quite astonishing how much it still shows.  Don’t get us wrong, they’ve done a magnificent job rebuilding, but you can still see the scars.  Some of the downtown is just buildings and empty lots – but one thing we learned is that the historical downtown of Christchurch is built on swampy landfill, which is why the earthquake was so devastating.  So … for those who have the resources, many moved away – evidently a good xx% of Christchurch residents moved from downtown to what used to be a suburb 20? miles away (one we did not visit).  You just felt it walking around – downtown Churchill isn’t exactly empty, but at the same time it doesn’t feel thriving either.  Net/net – few recommend it as a highlight, and we wouldn’t disagree (though we found two great restaurants, see above).  Manu in particular is doing some sort of indigenous/pan-Asian fusion, and was awesome.

Why we stayed in Christchurch is because Kevin is obsessed with Tolkien (a recurring theme), and the all-day tour out to Edoras was \*outstanding\* if you’re into it.  Really get a sense of place, it’s such a spectacular spot that even Tiffany (who has managed to basically never see the movies) thought it was an enjoyable day.

### Franz Josef

Franz Josef is one of the 2 towns on the west coast of the south island to stay in what is typically called ‘Glacier Country’.  
The train ride from Christchurch over Arthur Pass to Greymouth was quite lovely and relaxing – just a nice relaxing 3-4 hours, pretty though not spectacular (since it’s a low part of the Southern Alps) country.  
The drive from Greymouth down to Franz Josef was gorgeous – but not easy.  Apart from driving on the left (“wrong” for Americans) side of the road, most of NZ’s South Island is 2-lane (one each way) roads, particularly winding on the west coast.  And one exciting wrinkle is that there are 1-lane bridges all over the west coast, where you gotta learn the right of way rules (easy once you get it down).  It’s all doable, but …. The first hour or two can be a bit bare-knuckly.

The main glaciers have retreated quite a bit over the last 50-90 years (I think they think natural fluctuations, not ‘just’ global warming), so they’re pretty far up the valley from the easy-to-get-to viewpoints.  There are longish hikes for viewpoints that we did not do.

The highlight of this spot to us was Lake Matheson – super short (an hour?) hike around the lake, but some of the best “mountain reflected in lake” views we’ve ever seen.  The lake has certain characteristics (dark black silty bottom, relatively shallow) that make it an incredible mirror.  About 30-40 min drive from Franz Josef, a thousand times recommended.

### On the Way to Queenstown

First Light recommended we drive to Wanaka and spend 2 nights there, then go to Queenstown.  We decided we wanted to hop less and focus more.  We drove all the way from Franz Josef to Queenstown – that’s a longgg day, almost 6 hours of driving, but given that it meant more time in Queenstown we have no regrets.  Worth waking up early to do this drive gradually, there are gorgeous beaches (though be careful of biting flies\! Deet up).

The Haast visitor center was a great pit stop.

The town of Wanaka is a great stop, there are a bunch of restaurants on the lake, plus (see above) Rippon winery.  We enjoyed 2 hours there.

### Queenstown

This was the highlight of our trip, not that everything else wasn’t great.  We just found Queenstown a perfect blend of beauty, things to do, and just ‘feel’ / ‘vibe’.  It’s certainly not undiscovered, and the traffic in and out of town can get tough on the weekends if you’re there in high season (as we were, January).  But to us the bit of traffic hassle was far outweighed by how beautiful a spot it is.

We stayed in the Rosewood Matauri which was/is far from cheap, but was the nicest single property we stay in NZ – high level of service, great staff, but very small (a few dozen rooms?).  Maybe 12-15 mins from downtown Queenstown which you may find a hassle, but also a glorious lake view from the rooms and restaurant.

We flew on a day trip to Milford Sound, and can’t recommend it enough.  You can drive to Milford Sound, but it’s 4? hours as there is no direct route (d\*mn mountains); the flight was only 40 minutes, but even more so you’re flying just hundreds of feet above the Southern Alps, the flight both directions was just incredible.  The boat trip up Milford Sound is I suspect weather-dependent – we had just a glorious day, the water was glass, blue sky … note the Sound is one of the rainiest spots in NZ, so … not everyone gets that experience.

Per above, there’s a great wine country (Central Otago) a very short distance away, the beginnings are I think 20-30 minutes from downtown.  Some videos recommend biking part of the wine country, we hired a driver.

Queenstown bills itself as the Adventure Capital of the World – we did neither the Shotover Jet (jetboat going 70 MPH millimeters from canyon walls) nor bungee jumping (which was invented in Queenstown) – but we did watch the bungee jumping for awhile, we were happy to watch from solid ground while others do the jump .

### Kaikoura

Kaikour bills itself as “the Serengeti of the Pacific”, and it’s easy to find photos online that make it look like everywhere you look there’s sea life in astonishing abundance.  That wasn’t our experience … but it was still a really exciting stop.

In January, Point Keane just past the town of Kaikoura had a 20? Minute walk to just incredibly cute southern Fur Seal babies.  Total cuteness overdose.

We did Whale Watch Kaikoura.  We saw fewer animals overall than I’d envisioned, but we did see several Sperm Whales diving, which made the whole experience special.

Seal Kayak Kaikoura has foot peddle kayaks, which are a total game changer.  Your hands are free and dry the whole time to take seal photos.  We did a private tour, no regrets, just beautiful.

The Kaikoura museum isn’t large, but has a big surfing display (if you’re into that), but I enjoyed it for the tiny corner documenting the 2016? Kaikoura earthquake – the photos are riveting.  Our kayaking tourguide was there when it happened, I think the town was cut off from the rest of NZ for weeks?  Months? Due to road closures.  
The Hapuku Lodge near town is lovely, but a bit outside of town (10 min drive?), so we spent relatively little time in town after 5pm.   Awesome deer herd is resident at the lodge.

### Nelson

We went to Nelson to see Abel Tasman National Park.  Honestly, it’s a pretty park, but I’m not 100% sure it was worth the effort.  We took a small boat out to the park, wandered around, did a hike … but we went hours out of our way to go to Nelson and not sure I’d tell anyone it was the \# priority.

Per above, the town near our Hotel (Mapua) was very cute, very local not touristy, and nice to visit.  There’s nothing bad about Nelson & Abel Tasman – we’re just not sure 100% sure it was all the way worth the trip to get there.

### Wellington

We found Wellington well worth 3 nights.  It’s a very attractive town, on the water, and has a nice ‘feel’ to it.  

Highlights to us:

* The Ohtel we stayed on is right on the water, nice location  
* Charley Noble, a steakhouse on the water, was one of the best meals we had in NZ, maybe some of the best steaks we’ve ever had.  Grass fed yum.  
* The Te Papa museum is very rewarding.  Some of the Maori exhibits are incredible, and the Gallipoli exhibit, complete with WETA-made huge soldiers, was riveting.  
* Zealandia is a place very near downtown that is fenced-in and protected to try to make it as close to pre-human NZ as is possible.  We did a night tour and saw kiwi and tuatara – really neat experience.  
* We did a half-day Lord of the Rings tour, great if you’re into it.  
* Per wine section above, we found Martinborough a lovely day trip for nice Pinot and a nice experience.

### Rotorua

It was interesting, many NZ locals sorta recommended against Rotorua – saying it was ‘run down’ and ‘smelly’ (there is a faint sulfur smell near some of the volcanic ruins) – we found it outstanding, but we’re into geothermal features.

If one reads a history of NZ, in the late 19thC Europeans were almost entirely near the coast, and the Maori retreated to the inland areas.  Rotorua was a center of Maori culture and remains so, and it’s noticeable on the streets that many more Maori remain there than in Wellington/Auckland/Christchurch/Queenstown.

We did 2 main adventures:

* Waimangu Volcanic Valley: Waimangu Thermal Reserve Self Guided Walk and Boat Cruise – very enjoyable.  This is one of the newest (maybe the newest?) geothermal areas on earth, there was a volcano eruption in 1886 that buried a Maori village.  Gorgeous boiling lakes, and the boat trip was very pleasant.  
* One evening: Te Po \- Indigenous Evening Experience with Hangi Dinner Buffet.  The Dinner buffet was very ‘ok’.  I wish we’d done this differently.  They have cultural exhibits in the afternoon that we missed, but First Light booked us for the evening, which was a long dinner.  That being said, there was an impressive Maori dance performance before the dinner that was entertaining.

### Rotorua=\>Auckland

We did this drive so that we could see Hobbiton.  If you’re into LoTR, it’s very enjoyable.  We bought the “Hobbit lunch” or something afterwards, that was very much not worth (generic banquet buffet of mediocre food).

### Auckland

Most NZ locals won’t recommend Auckland – it’s big, it doesn’t have a lot of pretty old buildings, it sprawls a lot – it sorta had a Los Angeles vibe to me.  We didn’t hate it, but 3 nights was definitely more than is required.

Hotel Britomart was far from our favorite hotel – the rooms were just tiny to the point of claustrophobia.  Nice location though.

We thought Waiheke was delightful – very pretty island, even just the ferry ride is lovely, and there are quite a few excellent wineries once there (see ‘Wine’ section above).

Wandering the harbor was fun – Auckland is where a lot of the NZ yachting community is, you see one of their America’s Cup boats (and can I think ride in one, though we didn’t do that).  

### Cook Islands

The Cook Islands were once part of NZ, but are now in “free association” with NZ – meaning residents can come and go to NZ as they wish, and they share a currency, but by and large it’s its own country (there are recent disputes that the Cooks made some form of trade agreement with China without, to the NZ government, sufficient communication).  They are sorta kinda on the way back from NZ – you can fly Auckland to Rarotonga (the largest island in the Cooks), then at this writing once a week fly Rarotonga to Honolulu without backtracking the 4 hours to Auckland.

Tiffany had in a previous life been to Rarotanga in the late ‘90s.  She had always wanted to go to a more-remote secondary island called Aitutaki.  We spent 4 nights there and loved it.  It’s very sleepy, but the lagoon in the center of the island is … about the most gorgeous spot on earth we’ve seen.  There are a bunch of boat vendors, not sure ours was the best, but they all go to the same spots, a few snorkeling spots and a few islands that are just spectacular – straight from a Windows NT background.  Some people do a day trip from Rarotonga, but we were glad to spend the evenings here, and just enjoy the sleepiness.  There are 1800 residents according to the internet, and it feels it – super empty.  Our resort – the Pacific Resort – was gorgeous.

Rarotonga was nice, but a bit of a disappointment.  TIffany had been to the Pacific Resort (yes, same chain) in Rarotonga, and 25 years ago there was an incredible reef right outside the resort.  Sadly, evidently due to chemical outflow from nearby farms … the reef is completely gone in 2025, which was super sad to see.  The Aroa Lagoon Marine Reserve next to the Rarotongan Beach Resort was a quite different experience – we felt sorta bad walking right through the hotel lobby to get to their lagoon (you can also get in from a nearby park).  The first 50 yards or so from the beach were sad, lots of dead coral just as you anticipate from too many tourists, but if you just make a small bit of work to get a bit further out, it was the best beach snorkel of our lives, just amazing variety and super accessible.

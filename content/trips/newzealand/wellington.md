## Overview

We found Wellington well worth 3 nights.  It’s a very attractive town, on the water, and has a nice ‘feel’ to it.  

Highlights to us:

* The Ohtel we stayed on is right on the water, nice location  
* Charley Noble, a steakhouse on the water, was one of the best meals we had in NZ, maybe some of the best steaks we’ve ever had.  Grass fed yum.  
* The Te Papa museum is very rewarding.  Some of the Maori exhibits are incredible, and the Gallipoli exhibit, complete with WETA-made huge soldiers, was riveting.  
* Zealandia is a place very near downtown that is fenced-in and protected to try to make it as close to pre-human NZ as is possible.  We did a night tour and saw kiwi and tuatara – really neat experience.  
* We did a half-day Lord of the Rings tour, great if you’re into it.  
* Per wine section above, we found Martinborough a lovely day trip for nice Pinot and a nice experience.

### Going in early May

* Going in Early May was sorta a mixed bag.    
  * Good news: the crowds were very light, we could just walk up to very popular restaurants right at 730pm, especially in Milos and Paros (Santorini was already pretty un-empty).    
  * If you want the “Greek Island beach experience”, we found that almost all the beaches were nearly-empty May 3-13.  There are cool rocking beach clubs that open … beginning of June.  In May one sees stacks of lounge chairs that aren’t available yet.  So we weren’t shoulder season, we were off-season.  
* It was cool a lot of days (high 60s), sometimes almost chilly when the wind kicked up.  Definitely we were wearing long sleeves in the evening, sometimes in the afternoon.  
* We had a ton of wind, but depending on who I ask that might happen all summer – it’s super unpredictable, and can change quickly – one day was 30-40MPH winds all afternoon, then suddenly an hour later it was calm for dinner..  
* We swam in the Mediterranean exactly once (Santorini catamaran cruise) – it was refreshing to say the least.  Doable but hardly “relaxing” water temp.

### Big Picture

* We were recommended not to do “too many islands”.  It’s true that the overhead of the ferries – getting there 30 mins early, the transfer back and forth between hotels, repacking etc – means I wouldn’t want to stay at “more” islands than we did in 10 days (2 nights in Milos, 3 nights in Santorini, 5 nights in Paros).  But we enjoyed fitting in Naxos for 6 hours, and Delos/Mykonos for 3 hours each, Antiparos for a few hours – we only re-packed our luggage 3 times in the islands, but also saw a lot of different islands, while there are certain similarities we were surprised how different (for example) Naxos and Paros ‘feel’.    
* The contrast is amazing – Milos is super sleepy, with limited tourist infrastructure, and Pollonia’s “restaurant row” for tourists is maybe 100 yards long.  Santorini is nuts, crawling with tourists, but spectacular eye candy.  Paros was a nice middle ground – nice hotels/restaurants, a lot happening, but feels like a semi-real place that actual Greek people can still live on (Santorini is sad in its way, Oia is almost all tourists now.  One local told me she lives in Iveromigli and hadn’t been to Oia 20 minutes away for years because it’s too expensive and just for tourists).   So we felt that Santorini really is one of the most amazing ‘sights” we’ve ever seen, but on the other hand Paros was better for just hanging out at a slower speed.    
* A lot of our “feelings” are probably based on when we went – for example we have friends who visited Milos September 2024 when the beach clubs were open, and Milos was their favorite, in part because it’s a great place to hang out on the beach.  In early May, the beach isn’t really “ready” yet (and the water is d\*mn cold), so for us 48 hours in Milos … was plenty, because there’s only so much to see.

### Ferries

We did only 3 ferries so we are hardly experts – we flew Athens=\>Milos at the beginning, and Paros=\>Athens at the end.

We used ferryhopper to find routes, but invariably the best (fastest) route for us was with Seajets, so we booked in advance through the Seajets website.  We bought a week in advance, paid a bit extra for 'club' \-- the Seajets "business class" , it's just a bit less crowded and usually only 10-20% more expensive, seemed nice to me.  They had a platinum class for our long ferry (Santorini=\>Naxos, 2.5 hours) and that had at-seat drink service which wasn't all bad.

You need to check into Seajets online between I think 48 and 2 hours in advance to get a QR code to scan, just don't forget that or you have to go to an in-person desk (usually near but not right at the ferry dock) to get your code.

### Food & Wine

We’re not experts but a few thoughts:

* When you’re in the islands, the “pretty” “view” restaurants by the water (Milos, Paros) or on the rim (Santorini) tend to be very fish-focused, sometimes with lamb and beef.  
* There are often restaurants with more sorta ‘fast’ food – gyros and souvlaki and kebabs in various combinations – just 1-2 blocks from the great views, so decide what you’re looking for and plan accordingly.  Some of this more ‘fast’ food is insanely tasty, we should have eaten more of it.  
* Try Moussaka.  Often.  Yemeni in Paros makes a particularly wonderful one.  
* White wine: We like the Monemvasia (grape, not the town), more than Assyrtiko – the latter is tasty, but known for high acid which tired our palate over time.   Malagousia is very tasty too.  
* Generally speaking the red wines from the islands … aren’t as amazing in our opinion, it’s just ‘hot’ for red grapes.   We drank a lot more xinomavro from northern Greece when it was cool enough for red.    
* We never drank Ouzo, no interest, but really recommend Mastiha for a nice after-dinner drink.  
* Greek desserts are dangerous, and lots of ‘nice’ restaurants have a dessert menu, and when you say no, they bring you a free treat anyway that is impossible to resist.

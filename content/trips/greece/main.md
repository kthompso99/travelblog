Our Travelogues are *not* intended to be comprehensive, we’re not competing with Fodor’s or Rick Steves, just writing down “our favorite experiences” as we have friends who ask about them.  Feel free to share, there’s nothing overly personal in here.

See accompanying photo gallery [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/igktYXybMMdC9C6SA).  

We did a Barcelona-Athens cruise (mostly out of scope of this document), whose last stop was in Greece (Monemvasia), then did 10 nights on our own hopping the Greek Islands and then 3 nights in Athens.

| Day | Where We Stayed | Fav Restaurants |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 Monemvasia | N/A (cruise) | Matoula |
| 2-3 Milos | Tania Milos (highly recommended) | Yialos |
| 4-6 Santorini | Dreams Luxury Suites (great view, didn’t love location) | [PK Bar](https://pkbar.com/) |
| 7-11 Paros | Avant Mar (amazing) | [Yemeni](https://www.yemeni.gr/) |
| 12-14 Athens | Electra Metropolis (very solid) | [Thespis](https://thespis.gr/) |

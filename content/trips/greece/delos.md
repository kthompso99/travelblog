- We did a 1-day 3-way boat ferry from Paros to Delos & Mykonos with [Polos tours](https://polostoursparos.com/daily-cruises/delos-mykonos/). 
  - If you’re into archaeology/ancient ruins, Delos should be a priority, remarkable history, impressive museum. Our one bummer was/is that the signage in Delos wasn’t great, and we found doing it without a tour guide frustrating. There are day trips you can find from Mykonos (Delos is only 15 mins from Mykonos) that include a tour guide … if I coulda figured that out I would have, because I felt like I got ~40% out of Delos what I might have with a good guide (but I’m a history nerd, others might need less detail). Polos tours is a ferry ride which optimizes seeing both Mykonos and Delos which was great, but doesn’t help with tour guides. I’ve read that sometimes there are tour guides waiting outside the Delos gates, but that wasn’t true in early May … and who knows if they’re good?

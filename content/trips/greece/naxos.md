### Naxos

Before the trip, we spent a lot of time deciding between Paros and Naxos, and while we don’t regret our decision (we liked Paros a lot) … our 6 hours in Naxos made us wish we’d stayed there longer.  We figured out a ferry routine in which we went from Santorini to Naxos, arrived in Naxos at noon, did a 6-hour private driving tour, then took the 15 minute ferry to Paros, keeping our luggage in our tour guide's car – it worked out great.  Naxos is surprisingly different from Paros – it has an underground water supply, so it has the most agriculture in the Cyclades (including OMG the best cherry tomatoes we’ve ever tasted).  It also has neat marble quarries and a lot of interesting history (including some ancient churches; the 4th century [Panagia Drossiani](https://www.greeka.com/cyclades/naxos/sightseeing/drosiani-church-naxos/) is particularly something to spend 15 minutes of your time on).  

We can’t recommend enough our tour guide Alex, see him [here](https://www.toursbylocals.com/tours/greece/naxos/tour-details/naxos-highlights---half-day-private-tour-664d2315ebf20b195748906d).   Toursbylocals takes a pretty hefty cut, if you reach out to him directly at Whatsapp \+30 694 514 5018 and name-dropped Kevin & Tiffany, I suspect he’d be quite happy to provide you a tour.  We found him delightful company, he was born in Naxos but grew up in Athens, and spent part of his childhood in England, so his English is super easy to understand.  He seemed to know everyone everywhere we went.

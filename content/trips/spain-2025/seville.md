![These structures, billed as the world's largest wooden structure, were built in 2011. I love that the architect called them "Metropol Parasol" (umbrellas), but locals almost immediately started calling it Las Setas ("The Mushrooms"). I wonder if they'll be like the Eiffel Tower, which Parisians originally loathed but became one of the landmarks of Sevilla, this structure is on many postcards and the square seems filled with locals.](images/seville-02.jpg)

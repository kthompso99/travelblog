#### 09 July 2025 Prep Call

  * **Put the app on my phone Travelportal**  
* Travel plugs/adaptors?  
  * Bring US to UK???  
* Natural Selection \-- Whatsapp?  
  * **Yes – great**  
* Jewelry/wedding rings?  
  * Avoid bling – diamonds.    
* A few “at time to be confirmed the evening prior” we will find out for example the transfer time from Winelands to airport.  By and large, how will that be?

* How much cash?  
  * Premium cocktails – will they have CC handling in Botswana?   
    * yes

  * They sometimes have people repack.  Cut you a little bit of leeway.  No Samsonite.  

Cape Town:

* Safety on Kloof street?  
  * It’s like a CYA they have.  Kili says we have not had an issue.   She would walk over and car back.  
* Transpo in Cape Town – covered.     
* Tipping/currency in Cape Town (USD? rand?)  
  * Vic Falls and Botswana is easy – just do 2 tips (back of house, and guide), in USD  
  * South Africa – Airport transfers – get Rand.    
* Cape Town \-- book ahead for things like District 6 museum?  
  * Most people don’t give C.T. enough time.    
  * Botanical gardens – Kirstenbosch (weather dependent).    
  * Konstantia winelands nearby.  
  * Along the peninsula – go back to Nordhook.    
  * Camp’s Bay and SeaPoint – SeaPoint has a beautiful promenade.  15 minutes away.  
  * Woodstock has some fun shopping.  
  * BoKap – very small little neighborhood.  All city tours will go through there, and do signal hill.  She doesn’t think of it as super dangerous.  Unique culture – muslim/malaysian.  

Vic Falls?

* Plan ahead Vic falls?  
  * We arrive 130, D\&D arrive 120  
  * Tell D\&D to get their e-visa  
  * Someone from Old Drift will meet you – should be there by 230  
  * Boat cruise the first night – automatically offered.    
  * Next morning – Vic Falls first thing in the morning.  Guides will take you.

  * Game drives are ‘nice’ but not necessary  
  * High tea at Vic Falls Lodge

Botswana?

  * Open air  
* How cold in morning?  Will they have blankets?  
  * Do not underestimate how cold it will be – full jacket, hat, scarf.  
  * Use ponchos that they provide – put that over everything  
* Laundry facilities  
  * They are washing underwear now  
  * They provide laundry soap  
  * Bring 3 mix and match safari outfits  
* Local visits from our camps, gifts  
  * Botswana is the hardest country for villages – govt moved the local communities out.  
  * From Sable Alley – it’s a few hour drive

#### 17 Sep 2024 Jeremy

[https://www.grootbos.com/en](https://www.grootbos.com/en)  
Arrive on July 29  
Departing on the evening flight Aug 15

#### 31 July D\&D

We’re all in for the safari piece  
Joberg and CT – Joburg is where we want to be.  Not quite as committed to CT.    
They will do Joberg on the FE, not the BE.  Do a transition in Maun.  

#### 25 July Kevin/Tiff/Jeremy

Q:

* We have to book the flights to VF?  Help?  
* No more than 6 passengers?  
* Natural Selection vs African Bush Camps?  
  * North Island – private island vs land?  
    * “Water-only focused camps, the predators aren’t there.”  
  * She said Sable Alley is lower price point – help us understand  
    * Vs Khwai Leadwood  
* Both camps are strategically positioned.  
  * Sable Alley is great for game drives – predators, seasonal water-based activities  
    * 12 tents – fairly large  
  * North Island – classic Okavango camp, water activities year-round.  Mokoro rides, water-based antelopes works super well.  
  * Natural Selection – there’s a lot of very good operators.  Lots of very reputable, Great Plains, Kwando, etc – as well as African Bush Camps.    
    * We’ve known the exec team at Natural Selection for 30 years.  They are new as a company – Colin Bell (industry legend, started Great Plains, Wilderness Safari), Daven van Smixxx, Peter Allison.    
      * Prices were going up and up and up.  Natural Selection found a niche to deliver really good value.  We see them as stepping into the top top level without the top price.  They’re upper middle level, not the most expensive player – but deliver excellent value.  THey are staying away from the things that get over the top – some have natural history museum, TVs and air conditioning, and extraordinary camps.   
  * Intermedial plane flights –   
    * They are Jetblue/Southwest sort of thing.  Next Adventure isn’t set up to do commercial plane tix.    
    * They recommend Airlink – they have an air desk but it costs $75.    
  * Old Drift is the least expensive.   
  * North Island  
    * They haven’t been there because it’s so new – going next week.  
    * Exceptionally good place for wild dogs – BBC Dynasties episode  
    * Cheetah, leopard  
    * Makoro is unique – birds nest, frogs, not elephants/lions.  
  * Sable Alley  
  * Joberg is like LA, CT is like SF  
    * Anyone can land in CT and like it, they can get around, see neat things, built for tourists  
    * Joberg is kinda impenetrable to a first-timer, not super attractive – but does have Soweto.  It’s a major global city – great restaurants, etc.   The only reason to stay in Joberg is the flight is shorter.    
      * Cradle of Humankind is interesting  
      * One night in Joberg – just do an airport hotel.  

Tiff:

* One extra night in VF?

#### 19 July Just Kevin/Kili

Q:

* Brittany suggested Khwai Leadwood.  African Bush Camps vs Natural Selection?  
* Brittany said North Island has less wildlife?  
  * Natural Selection Tuludi?  Just more expensive?  N.S. North Island page mentions  
* How to think about dates?  
* One extra night somewhere?  
* Helis?  
  * She prefers it as an activity – low-flying, doors-off, wildlife-viewing.  Anywhere from 15, 30, 60\.    
  * Transit ones have to go higher  
* Was Anthony Bourdain cool to work with?  
* Answers:  
  * These are samples  
  * Not firmly committed to that exactly  
  * We work with all the major players, including Great Plains, ABC, Wilderness, Ker & Downey  
  * ABC has some really nice camps – Khwai are pretty comparable to Sable Alley – also Khai Leadwood.  
    * ABC has a place in Linyante too – I like that area, it’s very different  
    * ABC in Huangi –   
  * Rates are very difficult to analyze.  Transport …   
  * You save money with “one operator”  
  * Save money with one fewer flight  
  * Sable & North Island – very diff price points.  Sable is larger, more affordable – in an area with more camps around it.  North Island is smaller/more intimate.    
    * Other camps that fall into those price points.  
  * Recommendation is 2-4 nights.  We scale that based on variety of activities.    
    * Advantage of 4 nights – first night you find the pride, for 3 days you get to follow the pride, it’s deeper experience.    
  * Vic Falls  
    * City vs safari lodge  
    * Old Drift – viewing falls is “one of the experiences” – 2 hours, walking around the rainforest and viewing the falls, one morning.  Could be an 8-10.  
      * Middle part of the day – community walk-around  
      * Afternoon – game drive, or maybe river drive  
      * Long transit day from Cape Town – get in mid-day, leaving at 6am.  Leave at 10-11 from Joberg.  
  * Joburg vs CT  
    * CT is more SF, Joburg is the big LA – industry/legal, sprawling, certain areas are appealing.    
    * Joburg is a good intro, but not a good ‘end’.  Great climate – physically comfortable.

#### 17 July 4-way conversation

Questions:

* Who do you partner with and why?  E.g. Natural Selection runs both of the Botswana camps, are they organizing the transits too?  Are they really running our trip?  
* Kalahari desert?  When is zebra/wildebeest migration?  
* Why the stop in Maun?  Is Thamo Telele worth it for giraffes?  
* Small planes?  How long are the transfers?  How many passengers?  
* Mfuwe camp Zambia?????

Natural selection is a new company  
We’re contracting with services in each area – we work with Cape Town specialists  
Natural Selection vs Great Plains vs MChaba???  
Does the money stay in-country?  
Next Adventure is within Safari Pros  
Two emergency lines – Next Adventures.  Always a local emergency \# – general coordinator in each area.  

Flights – 40-80 person to Vic Falls  
Caravan within Botswana – 10-person aircraft.  Airvan is 6-person, but that’s rarer.  
Drive from Vic Falls to Kasani?  – 45 min flight in a light aircraft down to Khwai area.  Then 15-min flight across the delta to North Island, then maybe 10-min helicopter.

Southern Okavango – more dry open woodlands.  More cheetahs.  
Northern – more of a mosaic of seasonal channels.  
More towards Chobe – wild dog, more Elephant.  
Salt pans – fascinating ecosystem.  So much contrast, understand why the delta is so unique.  

Culture?  

Boutique/hands-on is her strength.

Botswana – the floor is pretty high.  Camps are quite small – 6-10 rooms.  

* Zimbabwe – Hwange?  Lion/elephant/buffalo, then Vic Falls – a lot more affordable.  The same camp is 30-50% less.  The brand/name recognition is just not the same.  Light air transfer.  Great photographic hide near the watering holes.

Chobe – you can drive to from Victoria Falls, that leads to congestion.  
Private concessions nearby that offer the same intensive elephant-intensive.  
2-3 weeks?  

Why Next Adventure?

* Founded by her 2 parents in 1996, they previously owned a very large adventure travel company before that.  
* She was named from Kilimanjaro  
* She’s been going her whole life, going back to Botswana in 3 weeks (first time in 2 years)  
* True Africa experts – that’s all we do, focus on wildlife and personalized experiences  
* Hands-on personal services (her or her husband Jeremy)  
* Very small, very hands-on  
* Who on the ground?  Partners they’ve worked with for 20-30 years – everyone from airport meet-and-greet are with the partners

Mandelkern:  
In the meantime, We used Kili at Next Adventure in Berkeley to plan our Africa safari; she was great, our trip was fabulous, and I would recommend her. We did South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, and Zimbabwe with her, including Victoria Falls. It was amazing. The friends we went with also used her for Kenya/Rwanda to see the gorillas and were very happy there as well. You should at least check out what she has to offer to get some ideas for your trip. Her contact info is below. The safari she put together for our group was not cheap, something like $25K/couple (not including airfare to/from Africa), but (unlike our Galapagos trip) I thought we got full value for the money spent.

### When to go

[Unforgettable Travel](https://unforgettabletravel.com/blog/best-time-to-visit-the-okavango-delta/#:~:text=July%2C%20August%20%26%20September%20in%20the%20Okavango%20Delta&text=Despite%20the%20dryness%2C%20the%20floodwaters,easily%20accessible%20throughout%20the%20region) sez August is best for Botswana. 

[Safari site](https://www.naturalworldsafaris.com/en-us/africa/botswana/when-to-go) – Botswana May to October

* May is arguably as good as the peak season, but without the cooler temperatures. This is an ideal time to head to the Chobe River or Okavango Delta to see varied wildlife and the Kwara Concession to look out for wild dogs, known to hunt in large packs.  
* June is the best season for guided walking safaris in private concessions, especially the Linyanti region, giving you the chance to stay in mobile tented camps and be right in the action. Elephants also congregate in the Chobe and Savuti region.  
* For those seeking out dry climates rather than particularly warm ones, July can be perfect. With less than 10% of the annual rainfall in Botswana, watering holes dry up further condensing game and birdlife to smaller areas.  
* August: As the winter season progresses in Botswana, there will be clear skies with temperatures likely to be below 10°C in the mornings and evenings, even dropping down to freezing overnight. There may be frost on the ground when you wake for your early morning drives but you will be provided with warm cosy blankets and there will be pretty landscapes for photography and as the sun rises it will start to thaw out.  
* Between August and September vibrant southern carmine bee-eaters arrive and their pinkish-red plumage can be seen across the savannahs. Camps in Botswana vary greatly throughout the year and some camps will be 50/50 water/land ratio in August whereas others will be 100% land or 100% water based so it is important to decide what activities you wish to partake in.  
* September is one of the last months that you can enjoy walking safaris and mekoro rides which give you a different perspective of the wildlife as you navigate waterways, past thirsty elephants drinking from the same body of water you are floating in.

[Go2africa](https://www.go2africa.com/destinations/victoria-falls/when-to-go#:~:text=When%20is%20the%20Best%20Time,flowing%20at%20its%20greatest%20volume.) on Vic Falls

* **July** is the best time to visit Victoria Falls for the mild daytime weather and good views of the Falls, even though the Zambezi is not as full during this dry season. July is also the month when the famous lunar rainbow makes its stunning appearance.  
* **August** is another dry month at Vic Falls but it’s slightly warmer than the cooler climate during July. August is also considered a great month for white-water rafting while the famous Devils Pool usually opens towards the end of this month.  
* **September** is officially the start of spring but still falls under the dry season. There is no rainfall yet, so weather conditions are perfect. September is one of the best times to visit Victoria Falls. It’s not too warm and wildlife viewing is good in the national park, but bear in mind that the later you visit, the drier the waterfall will be.

### Botswana

* Mokoro rides \-- traditional canoe  
* Abu Camp?  Elephant interaction?  
* Zebra migration November?  
* Jack’s Camp in Kalahari \-- meet Bushmen  
* Largest concentration of Elephant \-- Chobe national park

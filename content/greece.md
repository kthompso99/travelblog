Our Travelogues are *not* intended to be comprehensive, we’re not competing with Fodor’s or Rick Steves, just writing down “our favorite experiences” as we have friends who ask about them.  Feel free to share, there’s nothing overly personal in here.

See accompanying photo gallery [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/igktYXybMMdC9C6SA).  

We did a Barcelona-Athens cruise (mostly out of scope of this document), whose last stop was in Greece (Monemvasia), then did 10 nights on our own hopping the Greek Islands and then 3 nights in Athens.

### Going in early May

* Going in Early May was sorta a mixed bag.    
  * Good news: the crowds were very light, we could just walk up to very popular restaurants right at 730pm, especially in Milos and Paros (Santorini was already pretty un-empty).    
  * If you want the “Greek Island beach experience”, we found that almost all the beaches were nearly-empty May 3-13.  There are cool rocking beach clubs that open … beginning of June.  In May one sees stacks of lounge chairs that aren’t available yet.  So we weren’t shoulder season, we were off-season.  
* It was cool a lot of days (high 60s), sometimes almost chilly when the wind kicked up.  Definitely we were wearing long sleeves in the evening, sometimes in the afternoon.  
* We had a ton of wind, but depending on who I ask that might happen all summer – it’s super unpredictable, and can change quickly – one day was 30-40MPH winds all afternoon, then suddenly an hour later it was calm for dinner..  
* We swam in the Mediterranean exactly once (Santorini catamaran cruise) – it was refreshing to say the least.  Doable but hardly “relaxing” water temp.

### Big Picture

* We were recommended not to do “too many islands”.  It’s true that the overhead of the ferries – getting there 30 mins early, the transfer back and forth between hotels, repacking etc – means I wouldn’t want to stay at “more” islands than we did in 10 days (2 nights in Milos, 3 nights in Santorini, 5 nights in Paros).  But we enjoyed fitting in Naxos for 6 hours, and Delos/Mykonos for 3 hours each, Antiparos for a few hours – we only re-packed our luggage 3 times in the islands, but also saw a lot of different islands, while there are certain similarities we were surprised how different (for example) Naxos and Paros ‘feel’.    
* The contrast is amazing – Milos is super sleepy, with limited tourist infrastructure, and Pollonia’s “restaurant row” for tourists is maybe 100 yards long.  Santorini is nuts, crawling with tourists, but spectacular eye candy.  Paros was a nice middle ground – nice hotels/restaurants, a lot happening, but feels like a semi-real place that actual Greek people can still live on (Santorini is sad in its way, Oia is almost all tourists now.  One local told me she lives in Iveromigli and hadn’t been to Oia 20 minutes away for years because it’s too expensive and just for tourists).   So we felt that Santorini really is one of the most amazing ‘sights” we’ve ever seen, but on the other hand Paros was better for just hanging out at a slower speed.    
* A lot of our “feelings” are probably based on when we went – for example we have friends who visited Milos September 2024 when the beach clubs were open, and Milos was their favorite, in part because it’s a great place to hang out on the beach.  In early May, the beach isn’t really “ready” yet (and the water is d\*mn cold), so for us 48 hours in Milos … was plenty, because there’s only so much to see.

### Ferries

We did only 3 ferries so we are hardly experts – we flew Athens=\>Milos at the beginning, and Paros=\>Athens at the end.

We used ferryhopper to find routes, but invariably the best (fastest) route for us was with Seajets, so we booked in advance through the Seajets website.  We bought a week in advance, paid a bit extra for 'club' \-- the Seajets "business class" , it's just a bit less crowded and usually only 10-20% more expensive, seemed nice to me.  They had a platinum class for our long ferry (Santorini=\>Naxos, 2.5 hours) and that had at-seat drink service which wasn't all bad.

You need to check into Seajets online between I think 48 and 2 hours in advance to get a QR code to scan, just don't forget that or you have to go to an in-person desk (usually near but not right at the ferry dock) to get your code.

### Food & Wine

We’re not experts but a few thoughts:

* When you’re in the islands, the “pretty” “view” restaurants by the water (Milos, Paros) or on the rim (Santorini) tend to be very fish-focused, sometimes with lamb and beef.  
* There are often restaurants with more sorta ‘fast’ food – gyros and souvlaki and kebabs in various combinations – just 1-2 blocks from the great views, so decide what you’re looking for and plan accordingly.  Some of this more ‘fast’ food is insanely tasty, we should have eaten more of it.  
* Try Moussaka.  Often.  Yemeni in Paros makes a particularly wonderful one.  
* White wine: We like the Monemvasia (grape, not the town), more than Assyrtiko – the latter is tasty, but known for high acid which tired our palate over time.   Malagousia is very tasty too.  
* Generally speaking the red wines from the islands … aren’t as amazing in our opinion, it’s just ‘hot’ for red grapes.   We drank a lot more xinomavro from northern Greece when it was cool enough for red.    
* We never drank Ouzo, no interest, but really recommend Mastiha for a nice after-dinner drink.  
* Greek desserts are dangerous, and lots of ‘nice’ restaurants have a dessert menu, and when you say no, they bring you a free treat anyway that is impossible to resist.  

### Milos

* Pollonia is nice, quaint, and pretty, while Adamantas (sometimes spelled Adamas) is the much busier ferry port.  They’re maybe a 15-20 minute drive apart.  
* We stayed at Tania Milos in Pollonia and *loved* it.  Super homey feeling (we were chatting often with Tania herself), great staff, but also unbelievable location, just stunning water views from at least some rooms, and from breakfast.  8 minute flat/easy walk from the Pollonia restaurant row.  
  * We had the “Deluxe Room with Full Sunset Sea View” which yes is the most expensive room in that hotel, but Milos is generally less pricy (best room was less than $300 in our shoulder season) so we thought it was a great bargain, the balcony has perfect sunset views.   
* Food and drink  
  * The locals (?) say Yialos is the best restaurant in the main waterfront row in Pollonia, we thought it was excellent.  Some sites (TripAdvisor, others) list this as “Gialos’.    
  * There is an Asian (sushi) restaurant in Pollonia called Hanabi, I think the locals aren’t thrilled for whatever set of reasons, but we enjoyed it as a change from the Greek fish restaurants which all have sorta the same menu.  
  * Medusa restaurant in Mandraki is well-known (various celebs have eaten there) and worth the detour for lunch (and probably dinner) – lovely views, nice food (15? minute drive from Pollonia).  
  * [Kostankis](https://kostantakiswinery.com/) winery is a 10-min walk from Pollonia – it was very good, super friendly young staff.  It’s the only winery on Milos, and was a nice intro to local varietals.     
* We booked a catamaran cruise around the island with Odysseus Cruises – and they cancelled at 7pm the night before due to lack of staffing (early May grrr).  Getting a catamaran cruise is supposed to be one of the things to do, unfortunately … we didn’t experience that.  
* Driving on Milos is mostly good, but don’t do what we did; we rented a car and the helpful Budget employee ‘upgraded’ us to a bigger car, but there are a lot of narrow roads, so bigger isn’t necessarily better.  
* I thought it was worth driving to the capital Plaka to see where there’s a replica Venus de Milo – know as Aphrodite de Milos here,  near where she was found –  depending on how into art you are.   She has a great view of the water from her hill.  
* Be careful near Plaka, there are some narrow lanes – don’t always optimize for ‘fastest’ route on Uber, it’ll take you on some roads that are 3” wider than your car, try to stay on the biggest/most major roads.  
* There are some nice beaches,   
  * I made a quick ‘n dirty map for myself [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=10STMCKq4Tnfg4n-Z_B0SCEIKhQogt8I&usp=sharing) based on some online recommendations of “best beach in Milos”.  
  * We especially recommend Sarakiniko beach which is maybe a 5-8 minute walk downhill from the parking lot but sooo photogenic.    
  * Note that Milos is \*very\* hilly – so that for example it looks on the map that Fyriplaka beach is right near Paliochori beach, but there’s no “circle” road on this island, you drive 10 minutes back into the interior then back out to the next beach.  The road down from the interior to Fyriplaka is a bit hairy, you’re going down a steep road right near a quarry with massive trucks around you.  
  * Many of these beaches have offroad components; when we rented our car we were told “not to drive offroad” or something like that … I can only assume most tourists ignore that, since many of the best beaches on Milos … require offroading (this was true in Paros as well, as an aside).  

### Santorini

* We stayed in Dreams Luxury Suites between Fira and Imerovigli – the view is incredible, the breakfast wonderful, but I’m not sure we’d choose it again, it was a good 20-25 minute walk from Fira so there’s not much “right there”.   Honestly I think if we did it again we’d stay in Oia, it’s just that gorgeous – but Fira is more centrally located depending on your agenda.  
* Oia vs Fira – Oia really is disneyland/vegas-ish (no one lives there, all restaurants/hotels/shops), but damn it’s spectacular, far more we thought than Fira.  Many/most of the classic photos that say ‘Santorini” are from Oia.  
* If you’re into taking some of the ‘classic’ angle shots in Oia, they’re not right on the main path and were surprisingly tricky to find, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWoZJjqbdHQ) (the creator has the same for [Fira](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdWbX0SMdlg)).    
* We opted out of driving in Santorini, the small towns look hectic, but note that taxis are pretty expensive (35 euros from Fira to Oia).  
* Absolutely do a catamaran cruise; we chose [Spiridakos](https://www.santorini-yachts.com/) that was just top notch, but some friends did Sunset Oia the previous year and loved that too.  4 hours was plenty.  
* A standard thing to do is to walk from Fira to Oia (that direction because it’s more downhill than up).  We opted out of a 3-4 hour hike, Kevin’s knees are unpredictably achy on long hilly hikes.  
* Santorini wineries:  
  * [Vassaltis](https://vassaltis.com/) winery is the closest to Fira and Oia, it was recommended to us and we enjoyed it very much, both nice comparison tastings and also nice place to just have a glass of wine.    
  * Santo Wines is on the rim so is the most popular; we didn’t go but one sommelier we met (great guy who works at Kaliya in Fira) said it’s far from the best wine.  May be a good visit for the view, we don’t know.  
  * That same sommelier said he recommended Argyros, Gavalas, and Hatzidakis (in addition to Vassaltis).  We have no idea if any of these are any good; they’re further south so not quite as accessible to Fira/Oia.  
  * Santorini has a unique centuries-old basket technique for that protects grapes from a brutal sun/wind/soil combination.  Fascinating to learn about.  
* There are oodles of bars/restaurants that are perched on the rim for sunset viewing  – if you have multiple nights, I recommend taking one sunset each maybe for Fira, Oia, and Imerovigli, because each has a different angle and each is nice in its own way.  
  * [PK Bar](https://pkbar.com/) is in Fira, and has incredible views for sunset.  There are many spots in Fira that are great, but PK is sorta thrust ‘forward’ from the others and seems to be particularly awesome, we booked ahead for the champagne-front-row option, which was expensive but spectacular/romantic.    
  * Imerovigli actually has arguably the best view because it’s highest (1100 feet elevation, vs only 450 or so in Oia), and from Iverovigli you can see Oia (you can’t see Oia from most spots in Fira).  We enjoyed a sunset from “Wine Bar”, a hotel bar but quite nice.

### Paros

* Naoussa is a super nice place, seems much prettier than the ferry town of Parikia.  The high-end resorts are clustered around Naoussa.  
* We stayed at Avant Mar and totally recommend it – it’s a 5-8 minute walk from Naoussa, but feels a bit “resorty” (in a refreshing way) unlike many places in the Greek Islands – comfortable, nice pool (chilly when we were there), a nice beach with service, great staff.  It opened in 2023, and feels it in a good way, very clean/modern.  
* We think it was 100% the right choice to rent a car.  We rented a car for 2 days and wandered a lot, we saw:  
  * Lefkes was well worth a visit, a small mountain town that is a bit touristy, but was very picturesque for us.  We spent 1-2 hours just to wander and shop, longer depending on whether you eat a meal there (we didn’t).  
  * Aliki is a nice little beachy area with a bunch of nice restaurants right near the water.  
  * We went to ‘Golden Beach’ which fit under the category of “maybe it’s amazing when the beach clubs are open”, but didn’t blow us away in early May  
  * I wish we’d gone to the small village of Marpissa, I read about it later, but we sorta screwed up and missed it.  
  * We drove over to Antiparos (10-minute small car ferry, departs on the half-hour) which as promised was sleepy.  There are quite a few beaches; some of which didn’t impress us a lot, but again it was offseason.  
    * We drove the maybe 25 minutes from the ferry to “Plage Ag Georgios”, a smallish beach that’s about as far from the ferry as you can get on this small island.  We ate right there at Mpakas Fish Tavern, which has a great view of the water.  You can also from there see Despotiko, an uninhabited island with a newly-excavated Greek temple area that is from the 8thC BC (e.g., 400 years older than the Parthenon).   
    * There are a few “waterfront” taverna in Antiparos town, right near the ferry.  We had a lunch at [Taverna Yorgi](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g3569526-d6673076-Reviews-Taverna_Yorgi-Antiparos_Town_Antiparos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html) maybe 250 yards inland on the main street, and found its atmosphere delightful, we saw locals (kids leaving school, etc) wandering and living their life more than one might see on the waterfront.  
  * The 5th-century part of “The Church of 100 Doors” is right near Paros town and was amazing, super early Christian church, very different feel from western European churches as it’s Orthodox.   
  * Kolympethres beach has quite striking rock formations.  
* Some dear friends rented a bare boat to go around Paros on their own; we chose not to because we had some crazy windy days  
  * They rented it from [The Sailors Ride](https://thesailorsride.gr/our-boats/electra-compass-160e) – note smaller boats don’t require a license.  
* Food and drink:  
  * We *loved* Yemeni restaurant in Naoussa – incredible Moussaka.  It’s not “right on the water” like the 5-6 best-known places, so the view isn’t as special, but we went twice we liked it so much.  
  * On the water, there’s a bar whose name I can’t find, but it’s right in front of Linardo (which is on Google Maps), right near where you walk out to the Venetian castle ruins.  Great spot to watch the sun set over the water.  It’s this [place in Google maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lydia's+Charming+House/@37.1250863,25.2380653,3a,75y,90.79h,90t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sCIHM0ogKEICAgIDu1M27JA!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fgpms-cs-s%2FAB8u6HYjAocGF-8D9cIN-n5zhL7UIGkF1KO3Fh3qTarQaIXtNZBYzuDXh43VcNaLYku1uCKEA1rV-7BxL_hdZDGEoSAECadB2NtuFwQ1gsdJsUyKq0R4Psm7OdUkNtLIPnm4tyB-Bys%3Dw900-h600-k-no-pi0-ya90.79006991102646-ro0-fo100!7i5376!8i2688!4m6!3m5!1s0x149875fdcf0ff4ad:0xd4224d7849615f74!8m2!3d37.1201951!4d25.2390991!16s%2Fg%2F11rwx_7s7j?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUxNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), next to Barbarossa.   Nice staff at least in May 2025\.  
  * Siparos is a taxi ride from Naoussa, but had a great view for sunset, and was a great restaurant.  Note that taxis around there are stupid expensive, if you want to drive it’d be better (depending on what you choose to drink with dinner), we didn’t have a car that evening.  
  * Moraitis winery is a moderate-length walk from Naoussa, very very nice experience.  
* We did a 1-day 3-way boat ferry from Paros to Delos & Mykonos with [Polos tours](https://polostoursparos.com/daily-cruises/delos-mykonos/).    
  * If you’re into archaeology/ancient stuff, Delos should be a priority, remarkable history, impressive museum.  Our one bummer was/is that the signage in Delos wasn’t great, and we found doing it without a tour guide frustrating.  There are day trips you can find from Mykonos (Delos is only 15 mins from Mykonos) that include a tour guide … if I coulda figured that out I would have, because I felt like I got \~40% out of Delos what I might have with a good guide (but I’m a history nerd, others might need less detail).  Polos tours is a ferry ride which optimizes seeing both Mykonos and Delos which was great, but doesn’t help with tour guides.  I’ve read that sometimes there are tour guides waiting outside the Delos gates, but that wasn’t true in early May … and who knows if they’re good?  
  * 3 hours in Mykonos isn’t long enough for the island, but … it was far better than nothing.  We had a good time.  Tiffany went shopping ;).    
    * Sakis Grill House was what I found searching for “best gyro in Mykonos”, and it sure is popular, and we thought it was excellent (gyros, souvlaki).

### Naxos

Before the trip, we spent a lot of time deciding between Paros and Naxos, and while we don’t regret our decision (we liked Paros a lot) … our 6 hours in Naxos made us wish we’d stayed there longer.  We figured out a ferry routine in which we went from Santorini to Naxos, arrived in Naxos at noon, did a 6-hour private driving tour, then took the 15 minute ferry to Paros, keeping our luggage in our tour guide's car – it worked out great.  Naxos is surprisingly different from Paros – it has an underground water supply, so it has the most agriculture in the Cyclades (including OMG the best cherry tomatoes we’ve ever tasted).  It also has neat marble quarries and a lot of interesting history (including some ancient churches; the 4th century [Panagia Drossiani](https://www.greeka.com/cyclades/naxos/sightseeing/drosiani-church-naxos/) is particularly something to spend 15 minutes of your time on).  

We can’t recommend enough our tour guide Alex, see him [here](https://www.toursbylocals.com/tours/greece/naxos/tour-details/naxos-highlights---half-day-private-tour-664d2315ebf20b195748906d).   Toursbylocals takes a pretty hefty cut, if you reach out to him directly at Whatsapp \+30 694 514 5018 and name-dropped Kevin & Tiffany, I suspect he’d be quite happy to provide you a tour.  We found him delightful company, he was born in Naxos but grew up in Athens, and spent part of his childhood in England, so his English is super easy to understand.  He seemed to know everyone everywhere we went.

### Athens

* At a friend’s recommendation, we stayed at the Electra Metropolis, and found it excellent in every way.  We spent extra for the “Acropolis Suite”, which was expensive, but the corner room had just incredible views of the full Acropolis.  If you choose not to blow $ on that … the rooftop restaurant which serves breakfast, dinner, and late night drinks has all that same view for every customer without the upgraded room.  There are a number of other hotels in that district with the same ‘deal’ of a rooftop restaurant – we have no idea if this one is the best but we were pretty happy with it.  
* We had pretty mixed experiences with our 2 taxi rides – be prepared for tough communication.  You can order a taxi through Uber, I sorta wish I had.  Taxis are cheap tho, that was great.  We didn’t try the subway, it didn’t really go anywhere helpful for us.  
* National Archaeology museum – we spent about 2 hours there, maybe 2 ½.  See this [museum map](https://www.namuseum.gr/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nam-brochure-%CE%95%CE%9D-low.pdf) online.  The rooms are chronological (e.g., room 1 has the oldest piece, room 35 the newest).  Pacing-wise, the first 10-15 rooms are the highlight in our humble opinion, don’t pace evenly, spend a ton of time in the first few rooms, especially the Mycenaean room (\#4) which is right in your face as you enter – incredible artifacts, just that room would make that museum a must-see.    
  * If you’re a technology nerd (yes, that’s your humble author), the [Antikythera mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism) (arguably the world’s oldest computer) is near the end (room 35?), it’s well-explained.    
  * Rick Steves says it’s easy to walk through in order, but that’s not entirely true, be careful there are some strange cul de sacs; for example, there’s a scale statue from Parthenon at the end of a cul de sac that probably most people miss – it’s in room 20\.  
* We thought the Plaka district at the foot of the Acropolis was great, there are sure super touristy ‘lanes’, but there are also really nice restaurants that seem to have actual Athenians there, we particularly loved [Thespis](https://thespis.gr/) that we went to twice (OMG their beef skewers were to die for).  
* The Acropolis:  
  * We found a guide through toursbylocals (she was good, but not so good I’d automatically recommend her) who gave us a 4-hour tour from 4-8pm, we used 3.5 of that easily.  That was for both the Acropolis museum and up top – she gave us a lot of detail in the museum that I would have been sad not to have, we really learned a lot.  
  * Regardless of whether you hire a guide or not, you have to buy timed tickets for the museum and the actual Acropolis – separately.  Rick Steves recommends “end of day” for less crowds, and that way you’re doing 4-6 in the air conditioned museum, and up top outdoors 6-8pm – that worked really well.  We found about 1.5-2 hours in the museum just right, and then the 10 minute walk up the hill for our times entry at 6pm to the top also worked.  
  * Up top was by all means gorgeous, but realize there are only 2-3 buildings actually intact up there, you can only spend so much time up there before you run out of things to talk about with your guide (and of course about 20 photo ops).  
* Other ancient ruins in Athens  
  * In general the Agora was interesting, but less than I anticipated  
    * the good Stoa of Attolos near the entrance (an 1950s reproduction of the original building), which has a small but excellent museum.  
    * The Temple of Hephaestus is remarkable, it’s one of the best-preserved ancient Greek temples, and just extraordinary.  
    * We did the Agora without a tour guide, and found it hard to visualize much – maybe with a guide you get more out of it.  
  * We were a block from the Tower of Winds but somehow managed to miss it, which I regret, it sounds interesting.  
  * I wanted to go see the massive ruins of the Temple of Olympian Zeus, but it’s across a crazy 8-lane road and we ended looking at it from afar.  Honestly, when we looked down at it from the Acropolis, I felt like maybe I didn’t miss that much.  
  * The Benizelos Mansion is billed as “the oldest house in Athens”.  It has sections that are 16th century … it’s not “amazing”, but we were glad we spent 20 minutes of our time since it was right near our hotel.
